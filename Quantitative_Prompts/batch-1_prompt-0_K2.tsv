Schnur/OVP @ OVP cc: Elena Kagan/OPD/EOP, Michael Cohen/OPD/EOP, Christa Robinson/OPD/EOP bcc:  Subject: Re: Announcements/challenges for Monday's TIMSS event	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer without additional context. However, based on the limited information provided, it is possible that this communication could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications such as attorney-client communications and deliberative process materials. The involvement of individuals from the Office of the Vice President and the Office of the President could suggest that the communication pertains to internal government decision-making processes.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; That list sounds fine to me. From #2, I would only highlight a & b -- I wouldn't do the others or make much of them. On #3, I would announce both now, I think.	As an AI language model, I do not have the necessary context to determine whether the statement would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. However, exemption 5 generally protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process privilege.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Rahm wants to leak the school violence report for Monday a.m. I don't think we're going to get much pressure for announcements.	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer without context. However, based on the given information, it is unlikely that this statement would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 generally applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. This statement appears to be a discussion between individuals outside of a government agency and does not appear to involve pre-decisional or deliberative communications.
T0	T0	T0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Jonathan H. Schnur @ OVP	"As an AI language model, I do not have access to the specific context of this statement. However, in general, FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and attorney work product. Without further context, it is unclear if the statement ""Jonathan H. Schnur @ OVP"" would fall under this exemption."

Reed/OPD/EOP, Elena Kagan/OPD/EOP cc: Michael Cohen/OPD/EOP, Christa Robinson/OPD/EOP Subject: Announcements/challenges for Monday's TIMSS event	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer without more context. However, exemption 5 of the FOIA protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. If the record in question is an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letter that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency, it may be protected under exemption 5.
T0	T0	T0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Bruce and Elena –	As an AI language model, I do not have access to the specific context of the information you are referring to. However, FOIA exemption 5 generally applies to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and deliberative process privilege. If the information you are referring to falls under one of these categories, it may be protected under FOIA exemption 5. It is recommended to consult with a legal expert for a more specific analysis.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Mike and I discussed a set of possible announcements and challenges that the President could make at Monday's TIMSS event. Mike asked me to run them by you. Could you please take a particularly close look at # 2, the challenges?	It is possible that this communication could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication, as well as any applicable legal precedents.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The President could:	"No, the statement ""The President could"" is not protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. A statement about what the President could do does not fall under this category."
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 1) Highlight the importance of moving forward on his education agenda, focusing heavily on the voluntary national 8th grade test but also mentioning class size, modern schools/school construction, urban education zones, High Hopes, teacher recruitment and training initiatives, and the $60 million middle school math initiative in the '99 budget.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5 if it is considered privileged communication between government officials. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances and context in which the information was created and shared.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 2) Issue a set of challenges for the nation to help address the issue. calling on:	No, this statement does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications, such as those involving attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. This statement does not appear to fall under either of those categories.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; a. states to require new math and science teachers to pass assessments of their knowledge of math or science, and their capacity to teach their subject well, before getting their teaching license.

Parents will be able -- beginning at back-to-school time this fall to download a math and science quiz from the internet, give it to their children, and get a rough sense of what their children need to know in math and science and how they are doing compared to their peers around the world.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; b. New math and science web-site. On Monday, a new website will be available connecting teachers, parents, and students to good materials for curriculum and out-of-school math and science learning, drawing on the scientific resources of NASA, the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundations, and other federal agencies involved in math and science. (Thus has been a collaborative effort among more than 40 agencies. It will be ready Monday, but we could also save this for a VP event later this month that could focus more squarely on this website and give more credit to all of the agencies involved.)	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.
T0	T0	T0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON March 14, 1998 PRESIDENTIAL MEETING ON MATH AND SCIENCE EDUCATION DATE: March 15, 1998 LOCATION: Springbrook High School BRIEFING TIME: 9:30 am - 10:00 am EVENT TIME: 10:30 am - 11:50 am (meeting) 12:00 pm - 12:45 pm (remarks to students) FROM: Bruce Reed/Mike Cohen	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by executive privilege. However, without additional context or information about the content of the meeting and briefing, it is difficult to determine definitively whether exemption 5 would apply.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; I. PURPOSE  To bring together leaders from government, business, education, and the scientific community to discuss the recent 12th grade Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) results, and to issue a set of challenges to the nation to improve student achievement. You will also announce new on-line math and science help for parents, teachers, and students.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; II. BACKGROUND You will be meeting with 25 leaders from government, business, education, and the scientific community to discuss how the nation should respond to recent findings from the Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) that while U.S. 4th graders are near the first in the world in science and above average in math, U.S. 12th graders lag below the international average in both subjects.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; These results demonstrate the importance of implementing your education agenda, including proposals for: national standards and tests in math and reading, smaller classes with well-prepared teachers, modem school buildings, Education Opportunity Zones to end social promotions and fix failing schools, technologically advanced schools, and ""High Hopes"" mentoring to encourage students to take tough classes and prepare for college."	No, this statement does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies. This statement appears to be a policy proposal or recommendation, rather than a privileged communication.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In addition to reiterating your legislative proposals, you will issue the following new challenges to boost student achievement in math and science.	No, this statement does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 typically applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. This statement does not appear to fall under that category.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; • Reducing out-of-field teaching. You will challenge states and school districts to reduce the percentage of math and science teachers without a major or minor in their subject area. The average K-8th grade math teacher takes only three undergraduate math courses. Twenty-eight percent of secondary math teachers lack a major or minor in their subject area, as do 18% of secondary science teachers and 55% of physics teachers.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to pre-decisional or deliberative processes of the government. It is factual information that can be released to the public.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; • Rigorous Tests for New Teachers. You will challenge states to require all new teachers of math and science to pass challenging tests of math or science knowledge and teaching proficiency. With nearly half of our nation's teaching force to be replaced over the next several years in order to accommodate growing student enrollments and an aging teaching force, raising standards of teaching now can boost the quality of our schools for decades.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications or deliberations. It is a policy proposal or recommendation.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; • A Call to Action for Schools, Students, and Parents. You will challenge schools to offer -- and students to take -- tough math and science courses throughout middle school and high school. Only 25% of U.S. students take algebra before high school, and only 25% of U.S. high school students take physics before graduating. You will challenge parents to insist that school districts provide ways of showing how children are doing compared to national standards and international benchmarks. Today, parents have no way of finding out how their children do compared to the international standards in TIMSS.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; You will also announce the following new on-line resources for parents, students, and teachers:	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government agency.
D0	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; • ""Federal Resources for Educational Excellence"" (FREE) Web-site. A new website is available today to connect teachers, parents, and students to teaching and learning resources in math, science, and other subject areas from NASA, the Energy Department, the National Science Foundation, and other agencies."	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents. It is a public announcement of a new website and its purpose.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; • The TIMSS On-Line Challenge. The U.S. Department of Education will launch this fall a website that puts TIMSS math and science problems on-line. This will enable parents to give a quiz to their children, learn what their children should know in math and science, and learn how their children are doing compared to students from other countries.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications, deliberations, or documents.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Summary of the TIMSS Results: TIMSS showed that U.S. 12th graders scored among the lowest of2I nations in general math and science, with the U.S. outperforming only Cyprus and South Africa. Performance of U.S. 12th graders in advanced math and physics courses also lagged behind their peers from other nations. The 12th grade findings completed a multi-year study showing U.S. 4th graders near the first in the world in science and above average in math, with U.S. 8th graders slightly above the international average in science and below the international average in math. The 21 nations participating in the 12th grade study were the U.S., Canada, Australia, and many European nations. No Asian countries participated in the 12 grade tests. (See attachment of how the U.S. ranks compared to each participating country for all three grades.)	It is possible that some portions of this summary could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege, the deliberative process privilege, and the presidential communications privilege. However, it would depend on the specific context in which the summary was created and whether any of the exemptions apply.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; While there is not yet an analysis of the 12th grade TIMSS, an analysis was done of the 8th and 4th grade TIMSS. The analysis found that U.S. curriculum was less advanced, and that it covered more subjects superficially rather than a few subjects in depth. The analysis also showed that U.S. teachers often do not get as much training as those in other nations.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and certain types of inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda. However, it would depend on the specific context in which the analysis was conducted and the purpose for which it was created. If the analysis was part of an ongoing policy discussion or decision-making process, it may be considered deliberative and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, if the analysis was purely factual and not part of any decision-making process, it may not be exempt. Ultimately, the decision of whether to release the information would be up to the agency in question and subject to review by the courts if challenged.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Although other tests (including the National Assessment of Educational Progress) show that U.S. student achievement is improving, TIMSS makes clear these improvements are not rapid enough to keep pace with other nations in an increasingly global economy. Springbrook High School	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of a government agency. It is a statement of fact and opinion about student achievement and its implications for the global economy.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Springbrook High School is a good school with above-average test scores. Although the school has a solid math and science program, it is not particularly stronger than any of the other academic areas taught in the school. Springbrook has a very diverse student body (35% African American, 20% Asian, 16% Hispanic, 28% white), and it enrolls a total of 2,200 students.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any privileged or confidential communication within the government. It is simply factual information about a public school.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; [NOTE: Last week Springbrook High School held its first Anti-Violence Week, to honor one Springbrook student and one fonner student who were killed within the last year. Fonner Springbrook student Alfredo Enrique Tello, Jr. was brutally killed at age 19. Samuel Sheinbein (who fled to Israel) and Aaron Needle are charged with the murder. Two months later a Springbrook student Elmer Flores was killed in a robbery.]	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any privileged inter-agency or intra-agency communication.
T0	T0	T0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; III. PARTICIPANTS Briefing Participants: Secretary Riley Secretary Pena Bruce Reed Rahm Emanuel Mike Cohen	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer without additional context. However, exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) generally protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process, including opinions, recommendations, and deliberations. Whether the briefing participants listed in the provided information would be protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific content and context of the briefing.

D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; VI. REMARKS Provided by Speechwriting.	It is possible that the provided remarks could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and attorney work product. If the remarks were created as part of the agency's decision-making process and contain pre-decisional or deliberative information, they may be exempt from disclosure. However, if the remarks were already publicly released or do not contain privileged information, they may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether the remarks are exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances and context in which they were created.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; DISCUSSION POINTS FOR EDUCATION MEETING	It is possible that the discussion points for an education meeting could be protected under FOIA exemption 5 if they contain privileged or confidential information related to the decision-making process of a government agency. However, it would depend on the specific content of the discussion points and the context in which they were created. It is always best to consult with a legal expert or the agency's FOIA officer to determine if a particular document is exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; (l) Improving performance is critical to U.S. economic growth and individuals personal opportunities • Most of the highest growth areas in our economy are in areas that require strong math and science skills (e.g., information technology, health professions, systems analysts, engineers). • Almost 90% of new jobs require more than a high school level of literacy and math skills. • For students to get on the road to college and high paying jobs, math and science skills are critical. Students who take algebra and geometry go to college at much higher rates (83% vs. 36%) than those who don't.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; (2) We must have higher standards and expectations in middle and high school mathematics and science. • In grades 4-8, students in other nations are studying algebra, geometry and other topics, while U.S. students continue to be taught primarily arithmetic. • The content taught in U.S. eighth-grade mathematics classrooms is generally at a seventh grade level compared to the 40 other nations in the TIMSS_ study. • A recent international comparison of science and math examinations for collegebound students by the AFT shows that our SAT, ACT, and AP exams are much less rigorous than similar exams from other nations. • The standards of state assessments vary widely, and many 8th grade mathematics assessments are less rigorous than the NAEP standards. The voluntary national tests will help address this.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to pre-decisional or deliberative information.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; (3) Students should take four years of rigorous high school mathematics and science. • Only 25% of U.S. high school students take physics and only 10% take calculus. Most students do not take four years of high school mathematics and science. Even among college bound students, less than half do so. • Businesses can demonstrate the importance of a rigorous course of study by looking at student transcripts when making hiring decisions. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Alliance of Business, and the Business Roundtable are encouraging employers to do this.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; (4) U.S. curriculum should be more focused, instead of covering more subjects superficially. • At 8th grade, U.S. mathematics and science curriculum is less focused than that of other nations --""a mile wide and an inch deep."" The typical U.S. 8th grade mathematics textbook covers 35 topics while the typical Japanese 8th grade textbook covers 7."	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0	D0	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; (5) Teachers must be prepared to teach challenging math and science. • The average K-8 teacher of mathematics takes only 3 undergraduate math courses. In high school, in 1993-94, 28% of mathematics teachers, 18% of general science teachers and 55% of physics teachers were teaching out-of-field, meaning that they have neither a major nor a minor in the subject they teach. • TIMSS found that in a typical U.S. classroom, students are drilled to learn how to repeat how the teacher solves a problem. In Japan, students are asked to solve problems and then present their methods and solutions to the class in order to increase their own understanding. • This is why it is essential that states require new teachers to take rigorous tests of their knowledge and skills, that states and districts reduce the number of out-offield teachers, and that colleges and universities commit to recruiting and preparing more top-notch math and science teachers.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0	D0	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; (6) Our students do not start behind, they fall behind. • In comparison with students in other nations U.S. 4th graders students are above average in mathematics and second only to Korea in science. • The strong performance of the ""First in the World Challenge"" districts north of Chicago show that with the right effort, our students can be first in the world."	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of government decision-making.
D0	D0	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; (7) U.S. achievement in mathematics and science is improving, but not fast enough. • The achievement of U.S. students has improved in the last decade as shown by higher scores on the NAEP, SAT, and ACT. • TIMSS and other international assessments show that other nations are also improving. Thus, to improve our relative international standing and remain competitive in the increasingly global economy, we must redouble our efforts.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of a government agency.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; (8) U.S. student~ are mastering the basics of computation but have troubles with more advanced content and skills • Both NAEP and TIMSS show that our students do well in the basics of computation. 79% of 8th graders can add, subtract, multiply and divide. • Our students have trouble with more advanced content (geometry, measurement, algebra) and with solving multi-step problems.

It called upon developed countries to take the lead in addressing climate change and to aim to return emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. It called upon developing countries to adopt policies and measures to address climate change, but provided no aim for developing countries similar to the year 2000 goal. These differentiated commitments were intended to recognize both the unequal contribution of developed and developing countries to global greenhouse gas concentrations and the unequal capacity of those countries to control emissions."

In Berlin, the United States argued strongly that developing countries must participate meaningfully in negotiations over next steps. There was little support for the U.S. position on this point, with many Parties noting the failure of most developed countries to take significant steps toward meeting the year 2000 goal. The Berlin Mandate states that there will be ""no new commitments"" for developing countries in the current round of negotiation, but that developing countries will be required to advance the implementation of their existing commitments."

D0	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In January, 1997, the U.S. submitted a draft protocol proposal. Provisions on developing countries included three elements: (I) calling for the negotiation by 2005 of a new agreement with legally binding emissions targets for all countries, including developing countries, and a ""graduation mechanism"" under which Parties would automatically assume additional obligations as their living standards increase (the ""evolution"" concept); (2) establishing a new category (Annex B) of commitments for the most advanced developing countries (providing a halfway house between commitments of developing countries and the more extensive obligations ofOECD members); and (3) an elaboration of existing commitments (defining what would be meant by ""continuing to advance the implementation of existing commitments""). This final element contained several components, including a requirement to report annually on emissions and actions taken to reduce emissions and take ""no regrets"" actions (actions which would benefit the climate system, but which might be taken for other economic or environmental reasons)."	It is possible that some portions of this proposal could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications and deliberative process. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the creation and dissemination of the proposal. If the proposal was still in the process of being developed and refined, or if it contained internal discussions or recommendations that were not intended for public release, those portions could potentially be exempt from disclosure. However, any final version of the proposal that was submitted to other parties or made public would likely not be protected under exemption 5.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Support for the U.S. proposal is scant. While the third element is considered within the ambit of the Berlin Mandate by nearly all Parties, most countries have argued that the other two elements (i.e., evolution and Annex B) are beyond its scope. The U.S. has been urged to drop its proposal for a new annex. We have also been urged to drop our proposal for evolution (in favor of a separate agreement at some future date).

This group of countries broadly supports including developing country obligations under the Kyoto Agreement. Australia and Canada are the most vocal in support of action, while Japan, as host of the December session, is concerned that an aggressive approach would potentially derail the negotiations. As nearly all countries in this bloc have extensive competitive trade outside of the OECD, they are more aggressive in demanding developing country action With the exception of Japan, this group supports joint implementation.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; countries have taken a standard north-south line, arguing that global warming has been caused by the developed world, and calling upon the industrialized countries to pay for the clean-up. They claim that when developing countries have incomes and per capita emissions equal to those of the North, they will then participate in the clean-up effort. In spite of their often strident public rhetoric, these countries (particularly China and Brazil) have shown a willingness to engage on this issue on a bilateral basis. They have active domestic climate change mitigation efforts, and have privately indicated a support for many elements of the U.S. proposal. However, they all oppose joint implementation.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; OPEC. Well organized in the climate negotiations, the OPEC countries have been led by Saudi Arabia and Nigeria, and advocate positions designed to slow or block the negotiations. These countries have strongly urged: (I) that developing countries should not have to act now, and (2) that industrialized countries should compensate developing countries that might be affected by any action taken in industrialized countries to reduce emissions (principally noting that reduction in oil revenues should be compensated).	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example appears to be factual information about the positions and actions of OPEC countries in climate negotiations, which would not fall under exemption 5.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; An agreement in Kyoto that includes the current U.S. developing country position will be extremely difficult to achieve. State Department believes that, at a minimum, this would require U.S. support for a target and timetable perceived by the rest of the world to be serious, an aggressive effort to support replenishment of the Global Environment Facility, and an intensive diplomatic campaign. Even with these elements, an agreement that includes the U.S. developing country position will be very difficult to achieve.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the communication. If it was part of a deliberative process or involved legal advice, it may be exempt.

As drafted, the resolution appears inconsistent with the current negotiating mandate (which does not envision quantified emissions limits for developing countries). During the past several weeks, however, there has been considerable discussion with Senator Byrd and others about the exact meaning of the resolution. Senator Byrd has stated that commitments of developing countries should be based upon their own ""pace of industrialization."" Senator Chaffee has prepared a more moderate resolution that would require developing countries to take on commitments with a I 0-year lag behind the commitments of developed countries."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the communication. If the communication was part of an ongoing policy discussion or decision-making process, it may be considered privileged.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The original vision of the Framework Convention on Climate Change is that developed countries would lead in controlling greenhouse gases, and developing countries would follow. This is similar to the approach in the Montreal Protocol (the 1987 treaty that addresses stratospheric ozone depletion). Under that agreement, developing country obligations generally follow 10 years behind those of developed countries. Developing countries receive financial assistance for their efforts from a multilateral fund.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to pre-decisional or deliberative processes of the government.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Our financial contribution to the GEF was one of the original incentives to developing countries to support the Framework Convention on Climate Change - and to take action to mitigate climate change. However, while the U.S. had pledged a contribution of $430 million to the GEF over a three year period, Congressional funding has lagged considerably. FY96 and FY97 contributions were at $35 million rather than $1 JO million. The reduced U.S. contribution to the GEF will make any subsequent calls for developing country action under the climate treaty much more difficult to sustain.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; One of the most significant elements of the U.S. approach to encourage developing country participation is joint implementation (JI). Similar to the concept of emissions trading, JI allows countries to offset emissions at home through projects undertaken elsewhere. However, unlike the situation in emissions trading, under a JI regime, projects could be undertaken in developing countries - countries without legally binding emissions budgets. The analytic work performed to date suggests that allowing JI could reduce costs within the U.S. substantially. Developing countries see benefits as well, in the form of technology transfer and private sector investment flows. In spite of the potential benefits, significant opposition among developing countries remains (although support has grown significantly in Latin America). Many developing countries believe that JI could undercut the commitment of developed countries to take the lead in controlling greenhouse gas emissions; some environmentalists are concerned that measuring project-based emissions reductions will be too difficult; and some in the private sector and Congress are concerned that JI will result in significant transfers of wealth overseas.

The current draft (2.5 pm.1) generalizes this objective through the annual report requirement in section 3-304.  While useful, we do not believe that this goes far enough in addressing the draft Order's basic objective of either protecting children, affirmatively explaining why an agency may be making a different choice, or indicating that information is lacking to allow for a fully informed decision on child-specific concerns.

However, in general, comments on a document may or may not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 depending on the content of the comments and the context in which they were made. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature, meaning they are part of the decision-making process and contain opinions, recommendations, or advice. If the comments on document #154954 are deliberative in nature and were made by government officials as part of the decision-making process, they may be protected under exemption 5. However, if the comments are purely factual or were made by individuals outside of the government, they may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether the comments are protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case.
D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The NIH has serious concerns about this draft Executive Order. The topics it is intended to encompass are inconsistent, unclear, and confusing throughout the document. Commas make a big difference here. It is one thing to address protecting children in environmental health and safety actions. It is far broader and more complex to do so for environmental, health and safety actions, where health and safety must be considered separately and not just in relation to the modifier ""environmental."" If the intent is to have this order affect just environmental health and safety concerns, as much of the language implies, the wording needs extensive revision to make this clear. If not, the effects are so broad that this issue needs extensive discussion--it is inappropriate to be asked to agree to something this sweeping out of the blue in one day. The aim is difficult to take issue with, but the mechanism and scope need discussion."

As you have requested, I will briefly describe here the ""best case scenario"" from our view. We have been discussing this issue (i.e., the need for pediatric data) with David Kessler, Bill Schultz (his deputy), and their lawyers over the past year, and I think you will find them supportive as well. Everyone has put a lot of time into this and it has been productive."	It is possible that this communication could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications such as attorney-client communications and deliberative process privilege.

With most of our issues we would go directly to the AIDS staff but this is obviously broader than AIDS alone.)	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. This scenario does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications and does not appear to be deliberative in nature.

Just let us know what we can do.	It is possible that this could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the memo and the proposed action plan. If the communication was part of a deliberative process aimed at developing policy recommendations, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, if the communication was simply a routine request for assistance or support, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this communication is exempt from FOIA would be made by the agency in question or a court of law.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; As indicated during the conference calls, DOL's preference is to limit the E.O. to children under the age of 14. This could be accomplished in the definitions section and by including a statement in the opening section along the lines of EPA's comments this morning (e.g., the science indicates problems manifest in younger children; therefore, the focus of the E.O. is on children under 14). We would be willing to explore other options for excluding teenagers 14 and older.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the communication.

The intent of this Executive Order is to assure that the latter agencies adequately consider health and safety hazards to children when developing regulations and programs.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain privileged or confidential information related to agency decision-making processes. It is a general statement about the intent of an Executive Order and does not reveal any internal deliberations or communications.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; • While parts of the draft executive order (such as the second bullet) appear to address a wide range of health threats to children. other parts (such as the title and first bullet) appear to be limited to environmental health threats. FDA recommends that the scope of the executive order be broadened beyond just environmental health threats. Limiting an executive order to environmental health threats could imply that the most significant health threats faced by children are environmental ones. In FDA's view. while environmental threats are important, they are not the only significant health threats faced by children.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to pre-decisional or deliberative information. It is a recommendation from the FDA regarding the scope of an executive order.
D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; • While FDA recognizes the benefit of focusing specific attention on health threats to children, FDA is concerned about layering additional requirements on the regulatory process in circumstances where they will not add ""value” to the process. Thus, FDA recommends that any new analysis regarding effecys on children's health be targeted at regulations that (1) have potential disparate health impacts upon children and (2) are significant regulatory actions as defined in Exec.

However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the communication.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The first limitation (that an analysis of effects on children be limited to regulations with a potential disparate impact on children) will insure that new regulatory reviews are not required unless there is a specific reason to be concerned about children. The second limitation (that an analysis of effects on children be limited to significant regulatory actions) will target the new analysis to the regulations which have the greatest effects and which are already required to be subject to a formal cost-benefit analysis. If the executive order is targeted in this way, it will formalize what FDA should be - and is - already doing.	No, this statement does not appear to contain information that would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and certain law enforcement records.

D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; • The draft executive order requires that certain regulations be ""adequately protective” of children's health. FDA suggests that this standard be made less vague and more affirmative by requiring that the regulations ""protect"" children's health. In addition, whichever standard is used, it may be necessary to clarify that the requirement to protect children's health applies ""to the extent permitted by law.”  Without such a qualification, the executive order could be construed as an attempt to override existing statutory authorities."	Yes, this could potentially be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those involving legal advice or deliberative processes. This passage appears to involve internal discussions and recommendations regarding the language of a draft executive order, which could be considered part of the agency's deliberative process.

D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; As relayed on my voice mail to you on this date, the Department of Veterans Affairs has concerns about the proposed Executive Order (EO) because the vagueness and ambiguity of the requirements makes it difficult to determine applicability. For example, the term “potential impacts” needs to be clarified in such a way to better define and/or limit when a federal agency must consider the effect of what it does on the health and safety of children. The definition of ""significant regulatory action” should be clarified to exclude regulatory actions which are unlikely  to affect the health and safety of children. The annual reporting requirement in  Section 5-501 should be discretionary so that a report will not be required if an agency determines that there is nothing to report. It is also unclear what impact the proposed EO will have on an agency's budget for research or the degree to which the EO will impact an agency's contractual relations."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by the deliberative process privilege.

D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The Family Right to Know Initiative is a very positive concept that has the potential to fill an important void in the current protection of children's health from environmental risks. When parents and families know about the unique risks to children they can use that information to make wise choices. Responsible decisions by parents can have an aggregate benefit today and in the future.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In framing this concept we have agreed to a commitment to work with parents, scientists, the business community, and others to achieve the goals of getting better information to families. As we work with the stakeholders we can build on the concept of a family's right to know, and decide whether legislation is or is not needed to achieve our goals. As the Administration moves forward we should continue to emphasize our belief that we can achieve our goals in a common sense, cost effective way. That emphasis is needed to respond to concerns that we will put into place unnecessarily expensive approaches. I plan to continue to be involved in this initiative; please contact Diane Regas of my staff with new information as it arises.	It is possible that this could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege.

However, based on the information provided, it is possible that the document could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and attorney work product. The document appears to be a communication between two individuals within an agency discussing a draft policy, which could fall under the deliberative process privilege.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; While we believe the revised discussion draft of the Children's Environmental E.O. is much improved, as I noted in the voice mail I left for you on Friday, it still presents problems for DOL programs. We have developed several options that we believe would eliminate the burden for DOL without affecting the basic thrust of the E.O. As you know, our particular concern is that OSHA and MSHA focus on workplace hazards regardless of who is exposed. They do not address risk to particular demographic groups, but to all workers.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications and deliberative process privilege.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Background In August the President directed federal departments to identify ways to provide better information to families about products that pose a special risk to children. Since that time, EPA has been working on a proposal to fulfill this direction. The proposal on the table has two components: first is an Executive Order that would direct federal departments to consider all information about risks to kids when developing environmental health standards, second is principles for toxics labeling legislation.	It is possible that some portions of this proposal could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific content of the proposal and whether any of it meets the criteria for exemption 5.
D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The Executive Order, the ""Children's Environmental Health Executive Order"" would require departments, when taking regulatory action, to make a finding either that the action protects children or that there is insufficient information to make such a determination. In addition, the draft creates a ""Children's Environmental Health Council"" to oversee the implementation of the Executive Order, to coordinate federal research, and, among other duties, to consult with OIRA on regulatory actions that may affect children's environmental health."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific circumstances and context of the communication. If the communication contains legal advice or deliberative process information, it may be exempt from disclosure. Ultimately, it would be up to the agency to determine whether the information is exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The primary conceptual questions about the Executive Order are: which federal actions should be covered; how should federal departments deal with limited information; and whether the Executive Order is consistent with the Administration's position on regulatory reform legislation. The draft text has been in circulation only a few days, and I expect that new issues will arise based on the text. (Our next interagency meeting is Tuesday, January 28.)	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by the deliberative process privilege. The discussion of conceptual questions and potential issues related to the Executive Order could be considered part of the agency's deliberative process. However, the specific determination would depend on the specific context and content of the information.
D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The second part of the proposal, principles for labeling legislation, would express the Administration's support for a requirement that manufacturers label products with information about special risks to children. This proposal is modeled on ""Proposition 65"" a ten year old law in California. The key to the proposal is that it does not add to government regulation of product content, instead it requires manufacturers to test products and label them appropriately. The government's role is limited to identifying which substances are of concern, and perhaps identifying level below which labeling will not .be required. Proponents of this approach argue that labeling will provide families with the tools they need to make choices among products and create a strong incentive for manufacturers to reformulate potentially unsafe products. The proposal would exempt food and drugs."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and certain law enforcement records. The proposal may contain internal deliberations and discussions within the Administration, which could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, it ultimately depends on the specific circumstances and context of the proposal and how it was created.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Federal agencies and White House staff have raised concerns about legislation in this arena. There is little solid data regarding the costs and benefits of a national proposal, and the California model has not been rigorously studied. (We lack data on the costs and benefits of the California law partly because companies have been very reluctant to release information about their costs.) In addition, there are difficult trade and small business implications that need to be hammered out.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement does not appear to fall under either of those categories.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Status The Executive Order is in draft and could probably be finalized quickly if EPA generates support within the White House for that position. The process of coming to closure quickly could, however, cause us to miss some more subtle issues, and will likely lead us to draft an Order that is narrowly tailored to environmental health, rather than considering an approach that applies to all health-based regulations.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be pre-decisional or deliberative.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; EPA has drafted about a dozen principles to support labeling legislation. While these too could be finalized for the State of the Union, the lack of detailed understanding of the policy and political implications counsel continuing the staff discussions. Both 0MB and NEC have serious concerns about the need for legislation, and how to structure it most efficiently. (Recall that EPA proposed this concept at an NEC meeting in June and the proposal was tabled.)	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific nature of the discussions and whether they meet the criteria for exemption 5.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Recommendation The President should commit to issuing an Executive Order to ensure that federal decisions use the best information we can get to protect children, or more narrowly, children's environmental health. The interagency process to finalize the Executive Order could then be completed in coming weeks.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it is a recommendation and not a communication that is part of the deliberative process.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The discussion of legislative principles should be brought to a deputies' or principals' meeting to allow for a full airing of the issues.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any privileged communication or deliberation within an agency. It is a general statement about a process for discussing legislative principles.

D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Background A new proposal to create a federal designation ""American Heritage River"" is being discussed in a process convened by CEQ. The President would announce a commitment to this idea and work some of the details, including an Executive Order, later. Currently CEQ staff is proposing that identification be based primarily on the cultural value of rivers. The implication of designation is still under discussion, but would include a call for partnerships with the private sector, federal support for local initiatives and federal steps to protect designated waters. Initially departments have raised some concerns: a designation process will create false expectations that we can solve problems in many places; choosing waters for cultural significance conflicts with targeting environmental money to solve problems; as described, the new designation does not clearly add to current work; and we have not thought through potential political opposition."	It is possible that some portions of this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, this would depend on the specific context and content of the discussions and proposals being made. It is ultimately up to the agency to determine whether or not to release the information in response to a FOIA request.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The biggest challenge we face in making this idea work is to make designation as an American Heritage River meaningful. I am continuing to work with CEQ as they identify ways to accomplish this goal, but I remain concerned that we may not have good solutions by next week. I have attached the current iteration of this idea.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the statement. If it was part of a deliberative process or involved advice or recommendations from agency officials, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Status CEQ staff are committed to adding enough detail to a proposal so that a decision can be made about whether to go forward next week. They envision that further detail would be developed in coming weeks.	No, this statement does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which pertains to privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and certain types of work product. This statement does not appear to fall under any of these categories.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Recommendation There are thousands of people across the country who are working to restore enjoyment of their local waterways, and who would welcome new tools to achieve their ends. They need incentives to create jobs and revitalize rundown urban waterfronts; small grants to catalyze their work; better processes for participating in federal decisions; more information about environmental threats in their local area; and a federal commitment to work in ways that are consistent with local needs. We can do this, and we should focus the effort where people really need it--urban waterways. The current proposal, if it remains focussed on historically or culturally significant waters, is unlikely to bring these tools to communities.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of government decision-making.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; White House staff should be tasked with coming up with an urban waterways initiative that contributes jobs and environmental benefits.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; I think the key questions we should ask ourselves are: Do we want states to treat two mothers making $12,000 a year differently because one used to be on welfare and one did not? I think we do not -- we want to encourage states to develop seamless child care systems that focus on incomes, not categories. In that case. what is the best way to encourage states to develop seamless systems? I think it is not by setting benchmarks or other rules which encourage the new funds to be used for the not-formerly-on-welfare working poor to counterbalance current practice of focusing dollars on former welfare recipients.  I think it is by providing funds for states to raise their eligibility criteria to include more low-income families.

I do think we will be able to argue that we are helping stay-at-home parents through the $500 per child tax credit. I do also think, as I think you do, that an additional proposal here would be very helpful. I think such a proposal should focus on parents who stay home for more than 6-24 weeks. Thus, I would like to see something like the demonstration project idea, which would provide funds to community and religious groups (including the latter would be helpful) who provide support and assistance to stay-at-home parents, by offering parenting classes or hotlines, play groups, two hour “relief” or “emergency” child care, or which distribute materials to new parents (I though Barry’s idea of promoting connections to WIC was promising).	It is possible that this could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch.

In fact, in my in-box is the new issue of Univ of Wisconsin Institute on Poverty magazine which highlights an evaluation of a program called Avance that has worked with low-income Hispanic infants and their families in San Antonio since 1973 which has the explicit goal of ""helping mothers become better teachers of their children.""

However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the creation and dissemination of this information.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; • Since the 1980's, the law has provided that Social Security benefits must be cut off when a final order of deportation is issued against an individual because that individual engaged in Nazi persecution or genocide. This provision of Social Security law is specifically for Nazi war criminals and provides for an earlier cut off than for other deportees, whose benefits are not cut off until they are actually deported.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, as well as certain types of deliberative materials.

D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; • These individuals escaped the Nazi war criminal provision in current Social Security law because DOJ did not, or could not, get a final order of deportation.

It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, as well as certain types of deliberative materials.

Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those involving the development of legislative proposals.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Proposal  • DOJ and SSA propose that Social Security benefits be cut off when a federal court denaturalizes someone on the grounds that the person engaged in Nazi persecution. This is an earlier point in time than under current law. This proposal would cut off benefits of those who leave the U.S. before an order of deportation is issued, as well as those who attempt to stay in the U.S. by fighting an order of deportation.	It is possible that this proposal could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, this would depend on the specific context and circumstances of the proposal's development and dissemination.

Without further context, it is difficult to determine if the mentioned record falls under this exemption.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; I held the meeting yesterday with the DOJ, SSA, Neal Sher, former head of DOJ's OSI and representing the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors, and Doug Bloomfield, representing the World Jewish Congress & World Jewish Restitution Organization.

It is possible that some portions of this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications and deliberative process privilege. However, it would depend on the specific content of the meeting and the context in which the information was created or shared.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In summary, Messrs. Sher and Bloomfield presented a passionate argument that SSA's proposal will hurt prosecutions of Nazi war criminals. They want the status quo left alone and for SSA not to introduce its legislative proposal. They presented the argument that I outlined for you earlier: They deeply believe that some judges will act more sympathetically toward old men who were Nazis if they can argue that not only is the government trying to strip them of their citizenship, but the government is also impoverishing them while they are trying to defend their rights during the judicial process. They think that a single bad outcome in a case could have farreaching implications for other cases. They admit that it is impossible to accurately predict what judges may in fact do, but they hold the view with absolute conviction that this will hurt prosecutions.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications and deliberative process privilege. The information appears to involve discussions between individuals advocating for a particular position and may involve legal strategy or advice. However, the specific circumstances and context of the communication would need to be evaluated to determine if exemption 5 applies.
D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Obviously, everyone in attendance agreed that we shared the objective of not wanting to do anything to compromise prosecutions of Nazis. SSA and DOJ explained how they engaged in interagency discussions to reach what they jointly view as a proposal that properly balances SSA's concern about ""subsidizing the retirement of Nazis"" with enforcement concerns. It is important to note that DOJ concedes that there remains some possible enforcement implications, but again, they believe that this proposal is an appropriate balancing of policy objectives."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the discussions and proposals being described. If the information is deemed privileged and exempt from disclosure, the agency would need to provide a justification for withholding it under exemption 5.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In my follow-up with the White House attendees at the meeting, we agree that the specific enforcement concern depends on predictions on what judges may or may not do and therefore does not sound fully compelling EXCEPT that it is impossible to ignore who is raising the concern. These individuals are representatives of those who are the most concerned about and the most effected by this proposal. It gains us very little to close this SSA loophole if taking that action is decried in the strongest possible terms by the victims of those war criminals as undermining their prosecutions.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the communication.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; And make no mistake, Messrs. Sher and Bloomfield were absolutely clear that they and their organizations would protest vociforously. They would protest in the media, and they would protest in Congress. They would make sure that it is known that the President has introduced legislation that would compromise the prosecutions of Nazis.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; On the other hand, they said that if SSA is criticized for making such payments they would engage in whatever steps were necessary to explain to the public, to Members of Congress, and to the media that SSA's policies were sound and that anyone promoting an alternative view would be hurting prosecutions. There is already at least one critical article that has appeared (St. Petersburg Times) and SSA has been contacted by a Tampa CBS affiliate for comment. I think that we can anticipate other critical pieces, and it may be picked up by the national press. Cong. Bunning (R-Ky), chair of the Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee has requested information about the St. Petersburg story.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Given the foregoing considerations, I think that this is a very difficult issue, but I have to recommend to you that we provide guidance to SSA that the proposal should not go forward, Normally, I would give quite a bit of deference to Justice and SSA for the product of a solid interagency process. Nobody wants to provide benefits to Nazis, ESPECIALLY when some of their victims who are legal immigrants may face benefit cut-offs, but we cannot ignore the absolute conviction of those who we heard from who represent the victims when they say that the President will hinder the prosecutions of Nazis with this proposal.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. The language used in the passage suggests that the author is providing a recommendation based on their analysis of the issue, which would fall under the deliberative process privilege.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Dawn agrees with this recommendation based upon her participation in the meeting. Public Liaison agrees.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

FOIA exemption 5 generally covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and deliberative process privilege.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; BACKGROUND: The current law is that SSA benefits must be cut off when a final order of deportation is issued against an individual becuase that individual engaged in Nazi persecution or genocide.  The loophole exists, for example, for a Nazi who flees the country without an order of deportation. Under those circumstances, SSA benefits would continue.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or the deliberative process privilege.

FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or contain certain types of information, such as deliberative process or attorney-client privileged material.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; There is not a drop-dead deadline to drop a legislative proposal. However, the urgency of deciding  arises because the subcommittee Chairman & staff have been asking SSA as recently as  yesterday where they are on solving the problem of Nazi's getting paid. SSA has been putting them off saying that they are continuing to work on the issue. There is a technical mark-up, but this proposal doesn't have to be a technical (in fact it may not be eligible to be a technical). It could be offered later as a stand-alone (or alternatively a member of Congress could offer a bill and we could support that if we chose to) so the 23rd is not magical, but SSA is feeling pressure to get back to the subcommittee Chair fairly promptly.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to predecisional or deliberative information. It is simply discussing the urgency of a legislative proposal and the pressure being felt by SSA to address a specific issue.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Also pressing is a media inquiry from the Tampa CBS affiliate that SSA has also been holding off for awhile. They want SSA to tell them what it's doing about the problem. SSA anticipates that this may be the beginnning of a lot of bad press about how it provides money for the retirement of Nazis.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; This is a no-win situation. We are either going to be criticized for paying retirement to Nazis or we will be criticized because at least several major Jewish organizations will charge us with compromising enforcement. There is going to be critical press whatever the decision is. The straight policy call is probably that we should be able to rely upon the Department of Justice to determine the appropriate enforcement assessment and what will or won't damage prosecutions. And DOJ says they have struck the right balance. However, I don't think that the policy determination can be completely divorced from an assessment of the political overlay on this issue.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies.

States can still meet the requirement if SSA isn't ready, for example by matching data with prisons directly. But SSA has the best data and the law specifically says that states that use SSA data are automatically in compliance.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We met yesterday with Rahm, Gene, Barbara Chow, and SSA on a possible radio address on stopping fraud in benefit payments to prisoners. We agreed that there is some potential in announcing that other agencies (USDA, maybe VA and others) will take advantage of SSA's big new database of prisoners to spot prisoners who are getting benefits. We will work with OMB to survey agencies for programs where this might work. SSA notes Shaw is doing an oversight hearing on SSI fraud this month and that there will be a lot of heat from Congress in coming weeks on fraud, so this would let us take the offensive a bit.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication. If the discussion involved legal advice or deliberations related to policy decisions, it may be protected. If it is simply a discussion of potential messaging or strategy, it may not be protected.

Raines FROM: Barbara Chow  Chris Sauer cc: Jack Lew Diana Fortuna Peter Orszag RE: Use of SSA prisoner database for other Federal benefit programs	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This memorandum appears to be an internal communication between members of the Executive Office of the President and the Office of Management and Budget, discussing the use of a specific database for federal benefit programs. As such, it would likely be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We have identified some Federal benefit programs which have statutory provisions to reduce or suspend benefits to those incarcerated on a conviction or otherwise institutionalized. This is not a comprehensive list. The entities administering these programs would likely benefit from access to SSA's prisoner database. The following agencies, in our survey of OMB examiners, administer programs with statutory requirements to suspend benefits:	As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to provide a definitive answer to this question. However, FOIA exemption 5 generally covers privileged communications within or between government agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process materials, and certain law enforcement records. Whether the information described in the passage would be protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific circumstances and the nature of the information being requested. It is recommended to consult with a legal expert or the relevant government agency for guidance on FOIA requests.

However, it would depend on the specific nature of the information being requested and the circumstances surrounding it. Each agency would need to review the request and determine whether any exemptions apply.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Some of these programs are State-administered, which could make coordination of timely data matches more difficult.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications, such as those between government officials and their advisors. This statement does not fall under that category and does not contain any privileged information.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Recommendation for Executive Memorandum With respect to the four agencies, identified above, with statutory requirements to suspend benefits, an Executive Memorandum on the issue should require the agencies to conduct matches within a specified period of time with the SSA database to identify ineligible recipients on benefit rosters. Additionally, the Memorandum would require the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration to assist the agencies in whatever ways necessary to allow quick, efficient access to the SSA database. Agencies would be required to design a protocol for matches within a specified period of time, for example 90 days, and perform the first batch of matches within a specified period of time, for example six months. Thereafter, the agencies would be required to match as frequently as practicable but no less frequently than annually.	It is possible that this recommendation could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation and dissemination of the recommendation. If it was created as part of an internal deliberative process and has not been officially adopted or implemented, it may be considered privileged. If it has been implemented or shared with external parties, it may not be considered privileged. Ultimately, the determination of whether or not it is exempt from FOIA would be made on a case-by-case basis.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A quick survey of the programs identified above indicates that up to 20,000 prisoners may be receiving benefits improperly. This estimate is highly uncertain and should be verified with the agencies. Savings estimates, sought from the agencies, ranged from negligible amounts from the Education programs to $75 million from the VA programs. These estimates, again, are highly uncertainty, and better savings estimates should be discussed with the agencies.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Proposal of additional statutory requirements  In a note to accompany the Memorandum informally, all agencies that do not currently suspend benefits would be directed to review their program requirements concerning payments of benefits to prisoners using the laws related to the Social Security programs as a model.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The note accompanying the memorandum could potentially be considered a privileged communication related to the agency's internal decision-making process. However, whether or not this information is actually protected would depend on the specific circumstances and the agency's justification for withholding it.

D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Social Security Adminstration Since the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program's inception in 1974, SSI  eligibility has been prohibited for individuals who are inmates of public institutions  (including prisons) throughout a calendar month.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided about the SSI program's eligibility criteria is not a privileged communication and does not fall under exemption 5.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In 1980, legislation was first enacted requiring SSA to suspend payment to individuals convicted of a felony entitled to Social Security disability insurance benefits. This was expanded in 1983 to cover persons entitled to any Social Security benefits. In February 1995, P.L. 103-387 (the independent agency bill) expanded the classes of affected beneficiaries by including individuals convicted of crimes punishable by more than 1 year imprisonment (regardless of actual sentence imposed) and those found not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials.

D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In May of 1996, the President submitted legislation to the Congress that was designed  to give SSA the authority to operate an incentive payment program, through which prison and jail facilities would be paid an incentive for providing information leading to the suspension of SSI benefits to inmates, Under the President's proposal, when a  match of prisoner data against SSI data is made and the Information leads to a subsequent suspension of SSI benefits, the facility would be eligible to receive a payment from SSA of $400 or $200 depending on the timeliness of the report. In August of 1996, Congress adopted the President's proposal as part of P.L. 104-193.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege, deliberative process privilege, and certain other privileges. However, without more information about the specific context and content of the information, it is difficult to say for certain whether it would be exempt under this provision.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; -Other Federal Agencies Some Federal agencies that administer Federal benefit programs operate under laws that require them to suspend benefit payments to individuals while they are in prison. For example, recently enacted Welfare Reform legislation requires the Department of Agriculture to review its food stamp rolls to ensure that incarcerated individuals are not included in monthly food stamp allotments. The Department of Veterans' Affairs, in certain instances, is required to suspend payments to beneficiaries who are in jail. On the other hand, the Railroad Retirement Board, for example. does not suspend benefits to eligible individuals who are incarcerated. Many agencies, including some of those mentioned above, and the Office of Child Support Enforcement, within the Department of Health and Human Services, also need to obtain prisoner information.	It is possible that some portions of this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and certain law enforcement records. However, without more specific information about the context and content of the information, it is difficult to determine definitively whether exemption 5 would apply.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Focus On Problems When the President took office, there was a lot of work that needed ta be done to establish an efficient and effeetlve prisoner suspension operation within the Social Security Administration. We found that many prison officials were not aware of the statutory provision requiring the suspension of Social Security and SSI payments to inmates.  In addition, there was no formal process for obtaining this Information from the facilities. Many agreements were informal, ad hoc, which made them difficult to administer and control.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Because the facilities were not aware of the requirements, many reported only once or twice a year to SSA, often the Information was Incomplete and reported manually. The prison officials viewed the requirement as another unfunded mandate. Additionally, some correctional institutions are reluctant to enter into agreements with SSA because of the potential cost to them when Incarcerated individuals lose their Medicare or Medicaid eligibility	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and certain types of inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda. However, it would depend on the specific context and content of the information, as well as any applicable case law or agency policies.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; There were serious limitations in SSA's prisoner suspension program. The internal processes were fragmented and lacked adequate controls and most tasks were manual. This resulted in the inability to stop payments to prisoners in a timely manner. Even when agreements were in place, SSA lacked a method for monitoring the facilities' compliance.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and attorney work product. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the information, and whether it meets the criteria for exemption 5 protection.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Moreover across the Federal govemment, there has been no consistent effort for appropriately suspending payments to incarcerated individuals or data sharing  of prisoner information among agencies. Because of the numerous Federal and State statutes that govern the redisclosure of prisoner information, Federal agencies are hindered from sharing prisoner information.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and certain deliberative process materials. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the information.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; RESULTS TO DATE Under this Administration, SSA initiated an aggressive course of action that has resulted in significant improvements in the prisoner suspension process. Over the past few years, SSA has completed a major initiative to contact and establish agreements with all correctional facilities across the United States. As a result of this, SSA has agreements with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, all State prisons and the 25 largest local jail systems to provide us prisoner data. In addition, the Agency has agreements with over 3,500 local jails. SSA has worked with Governors, heads of correctional institutions, correctional associations and similar stakeholders to obtain their help and support in providing prisoner data on a regular basis. The cooperation of State and local correctional administrators is critical to the suspension process. SSA has developed an excellent working relationship with these administrators and the associations that represent them.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or the deliberative process privilege. However, it would depend on the specific context in which this information was created and shared. If it was part of internal discussions or communications related to policy development or decision-making, it could potentially be protected. If it was simply a summary of actions taken by the agency, it may not be protected.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; As a result of these efforts, prisons and jails representing over 99 percent of the nation’s inmate population are reporting the names and Social Security numbers of incarcerated individuals to SSA. Because of our aggressive efforts to obtain information on prisoners, who are not eligible for benefits, well over 100,000 prisoners had their benefits suspended during 1995 and 1996 alone. For the period 1995-2001, our actions will result in the suspension of payments of nearly $3.5 billion. Programs such aa Social Security and Supplemental Security Income need to be protected to ensure! that only those who are eliglble for benefits are receiving them, and we are proud of the significant savings we have achieved.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications and deliberative process privilege. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances of the information and how it was created or obtained.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; As noted earlier, there is a need to address the sharing of prisoner information among Federal agencies. Officials from the Food Stamp Program have recently contacted SSA for prisoner information. There needs to be a coordinated effort within the Federal government regarding the sharing of information about incarcerated individuals. This will ensure that all provisions precluding benefits to incarcerated individuals are enforced. In addition, there needs to be a greater recognition of the medical costs associated with the prisoner population particularly those costs associated with aging and addiction.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential. It is discussing the need for coordination and recognition of certain issues related to incarcerated individuals, but does not contain any privileged or confidential information.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; NEXT STEPS NEEDED: Although we have had successes, more remains to be done. The President is therefore directing that:	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

This statement appears to be a directive from the President and does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The Director of the Office of Management and Budget analyze the consistency of Federal policy with regard to the eligibility for benefits of individuals in prison and make recommendations for any legislative changes that may be necessary or appropriate. The Commissioner of Social Security develop a set of plans and proposals to share prisoner data that SSA obtains from prison administrators with other Federal agencies that need it in order to further ensure that prisoners are not receiving any Federal benefit for which they are not eligible.	It is possible that these actions could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and content of the communications. If the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Commissioner of Social Security were discussing sensitive policy decisions or legal advice, for example, those communications could be exempt from disclosure. On the other hand, if the communications were simply administrative in nature and did not involve privileged information, they may not be exempt. Ultimately, it would be up to the agency to determine whether the exemption applies in a given case.

Shimabukuro/OPD/EOP bee: Subject: McCaffrey Memo BR/EK:	As an AI language model, I do not have the necessary context to determine whether the mentioned record would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 generally covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and certain deliberative process materials. However, the specific content and circumstances of the record would need to be evaluated to determine if it falls under this exemption. It is recommended to consult with a legal expert or the relevant agency for further guidance.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Here are my comment/recs on McCaffrey's scheduling memo to the President:	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a specific answer without the context of the memo and the content of the comment/recommendations. However, FOIA exemption 5 generally protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional, deliberative, and privileged. If the comment/recommendations are part of such communications, they may be protected under exemption 5.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 1. National Rollout of the Youth Media Campaign. We should support a roH-0111 of this signature anti-drug initiative. However, for the President not to be disappointed, we need to make sure Rahm takes the lead in getting ONDCP to come up with some specific announcements – i.e., new anti-drug ads, additional private sector partners and commitments, results from the 6-month/12-city pilot, etc.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications. It appears to be a directive or suggestion for action to be taken by a specific individual or agency.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 2. U.N. Special Session on Drugs. I understand scheduling has already committed to do this, and that NSC is taking the lead. There is very little of our stuff here.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege, deliberative process privilege, and presidential communications privilege. The mention of NSC taking the lead suggests that this may be a communication related to internal agency decision-making or strategy, which could fall under the deliberative process privilege. However, without more context it is difficult to determine definitively whether this information would be exempt from FOIA disclosure.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 3. Drug-Free Communities Rollout. The President just signed off on the proposed candidates for the Drug-Free Communities board, and Personnel says that it will take another 4 to 6 weeks to fully vet these folks. I would not, however, recommend this as a stand-alone event. The board does not include any really big names, and the grants are so small ($10 million). Moreover, the Hill Dems were not happy when we did a signing ceremony with the R's on this. They hate that the R's vote against funding for virtually every other community-based drug program -- to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars -- and then turn around and support these tiny grants for community organizations. If anything, we should roll this into the media campaign announcement. It will allow us to say we're linking our national ant-drug message with action at the grass roots.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to pre-decisional or deliberative information. It is discussing the rollout of a program and political considerations, which are not exempt from FOIA.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 4. President's Drug Advisory Council. This is a bit of a problem. As I've mentioned, QMB -for themselves and on behalf of various agencies -- has expressed serious concerns about ONDCP wanting to discuss its performance measurement system at this meeting. I would defer Them on when it’s appropriate to do this.	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer without more context. However, exemption 5 of the FOIA protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. It is possible that the information related to the President's Drug Advisory Council could fall under this exemption if it is considered an inter-agency or intra-agency communication.

D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Due to a scheduling conflict, am unable to attend your event tomorrow. Look forward to seeing the results of your efforts. Continue to believe that the key to our success in combating drugs remains a united, nonpartisan commitment.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government. It is a simple message declining an invitation and expressing a general belief.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Over the last two years, the Administration and the Congress have been able to work together to deliver a number of important victories against drugs.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; • With Congress' help, we put in place a $195 million Anti-Drug Youth Media Campaign that is producing real progress. Preliminary results from the Campaign's first pilot phase show that 97 percent of the people in these media markets say they have seen our ads. Eighty percent say that the ads encouraged conversations about drug use.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government. It is a statement of facts and results from a government program.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; • Together, we also succeeded in establishing the Drug-Free Communities Program, which will soon empower community anti-drug groups in countless towns and cities across the nation.

No, this statement does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided does not appear to fall under this category.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; This sort of comprehensive approach, embodied in our National Drug Control Strategy, requires the unflinching support of all segments of the American people to succeed. For that very reason, we cannot allow partisanship to unbalance our counter-drug policies. The taint of partisanship would only cause us to lose vital ground in our efforts to reduce drug abuse and its consequences in America down to a historic new low. Your support, and that of all the members of Congress who take their leadership from you, in maintaining unity of purpose is essential. America can ill afford us to shift our attention from our real goals -- reducing the demand for drugs through education and prevention, and breaking the sources of supply through law enforcement and international cooperation.	It is unlikely that this statement would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not appear to contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of government decision-making.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The Administration's counter-drug agenda, much of which is reflected in your current thinking, will build upon these successes. It is imperative that we: expand programs to break the cycle of drugs and crime, particularly through increased treatment within the criminal justice system; strengthen prevention efforts, such as the Drug Free Schools Program, that target our nation's young people; reauthorize the Office of National Drug Control Policy; and, sign into law a new juvenile justice bill. These are just four of the many areas where a nonpartisan commitment to progress over politics can make a real difference for the American people.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government.

Shimabukuro/OPD/EOP Subject: Drug Miscellany Bruce/Elena:	It is unclear whether the provided information would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not provide enough context or information about the content of the record. FOIA exemption 5 generally applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional, deliberative, and privileged. Without more information about the content of the record, it is impossible to determine whether it meets these criteria.
D1	D0	D0	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; I'm red dotting the Gingrich speech to you, in case you want to skim it (it's actually a pretty good speech, I think) and read the three paragraphs on drugs. Basically, he lists a drug-free America as his first out of four priorities (education, pensions/retirement and taxes are the other three), and he says that Congress will pass a bill this year to expand McCaffrey's authority so he can develop a ""World War II-style victory plan."" He also mentions ""sealing up” the border  and states that, generally, it will take us about 10 to 12 years to reach our goals on all of the four priority issues."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch.

He will call for ""opening a second front in the drug war"" to treat and train these offenders. Thus, I think if Rahm wants to do the radio address on the directive (Leanne's working up a draft), we should think about leaking the directive on Thursday to get in the stories. In fact, even if we don't do the radio address on this, we should still condiser leaking the directive for Thursday. I'll send a copy of CASA's draft press release."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and attorney work product. The mention of a draft press release and the suggestion to leak the directive could be considered part of the agency's deliberative process and therefore exempt from disclosure.

It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; OMB is especially concerned about McCaffrey's report and letter forcing the Administration's hand on budget issues and conceivably violating the Balance Budget Agreement. They want McCaffrey's letter to Gingrich amended and the report held and coordinated w/the overall budget process. Raines intends to send a brief memo late tonight/early tomorrow (draft attached) to Erskine and Rahm suggesting as much.	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer as to whether the mentioned information would be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

Justice, Treasury and HHS are now only realizing what's in McCaffrey's report/letter and are likely to be b*llsh*t if they go to the Hill in their current form. I expect that you may all encounter this dilemma at tomorrow's senior staff meeting or soon thereafter. Call me if you have Q's.	It is unlikely that this would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not appear to be a communication that is privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials.

The document indicates that the proposed performance targets must be supported by funding if they are to be realized."	It is possible that this document could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the document contains internal deliberations or recommendations, it may be considered pre-decisional and therefore exempt from disclosure.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We have no evidence that would suggest that the draft goals can be achieved without substantial increases in Federal drug budgets in 1999 and beyond. Several agencies have made similar complaints to ONDCP (e.g., Justice and Treasury). As such, release of the document would be problematic and would imply FY 1999 budgetary trade-offs not yet made in favor of anti-drug spending and against other domestic discretionary spending. We suggest that the document be withheld until after submission of the 1999 President's Budget, when all agencies must submit their performance plans and targets to Congress. Those plans must be directly linked to multi-year Presidential budget request levels.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those that are pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. The language suggests that the document contains internal agency deliberations about budgetary trade-offs and priorities, which could be considered pre-decisional.

No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials.

However, this would depend on the specific content of the directive and the context in which it was created. If the directive contains sensitive or confidential information related to ongoing policy discussions or legal proceedings, it may be exempt from disclosure.

The President also announced that his FY 1999 budget will include nearly $200 million for a series of initiatives to promote coerced abstinence and treatment in the criminal justice system. Towards a National Policy of Coerced Abstinence	It is possible that some parts of this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. However, this would depend on the specific context and content of the communication. For example, if the statement includes legal advice or deliberative discussions among government officials, those portions may be exempt from disclosure. However, factual information or policy decisions would not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this statement is exempt from FOIA disclosure would need to be made on a case-by-case basis.

D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A. While crime rates continue to drop and overall drug use is down, illegal drugs remain an enormous factor behind the level of crime and violence in America. Drug addicts are involved in approximately 3 to 5 times the number of criminal incidents as arrestees who do not use drugs. Last week, Columbia University's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) released a study confirming the need for coerced abstinence and treatment in the criminal justice system. CASA's study found that 1.4 million offenders -- or 80% of the I. 7 million criminals in prison and jails -- were either high on drugs or alcohol when arrested, stole property to buy drugs, or have a history of drug and alcohol abuse.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Drug test results and anecdotal information reveal that even while incarcerated, offenders can gain access to drugs.

We know that drug testing'and treatment can help to break the cycle of drugs and crime. Convicted offenders who undergo drug testing and treatment while in prisons and after release are approximately twice as likely to stay drugfree and crime-free as those offenders who do not receive drug testing and treatment. Today's directive and the resources proposed in the President's budget will help us get to zero tolerance for drugs in prison and to helps state to cut crime and recidivism linked to drug abuse.

However, if the information is already public or does not involve privileged communications, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether a specific request is exempt from FOIA will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the request.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A. The President's action today builds on his strong record of accomplishment in this area. In 1996, the President launched the first comprehensive effort to address the drug problem in our state criminal justice systems. President Clinton fought for and signed legislation to require states-- whose criminal justice systems house the vast majority of drug dependent offenders-- to drug test prisoners and parolees as a condition of receiving federal prison grants. Under the President's initiative, states must submit comprehensive plans of drug testing and intervention for prisoners and parolees by March 1, 1998 and implement them by September 1, 1998.

However, based on the information provided, it is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. If this statement was part of an internal communication between government officials discussing policy decisions or strategy, it may be exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The President has taken numerous other actions to combat the problem of drug abuse by offenders involved in the criminal justice system including: doubling the number of federal arrestees drug tested in 24 judicial districts; fighting to launch a $1 billion initiative to spread Drug Courts across the country; and expanding drug testing, intervention and treatment in Federal prisons through his budgets and the 1994 Crime Act.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or deliberations. It is a statement of actions taken by the President and does not involve any internal government communications.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q. Is the federal government tracking the problem of drug use in its own prisons? What are you doing about the drug problem in federal prisons?	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and certain law enforcement records. However, it would depend on the specific context and content of the information being requested.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A. Under the leadership of Attorney General Reno, the federal Bureau of Prisons is carrying out model programs in drug testing, drug treatment, and drug detection.	No, this statement does not appear to contain information that would be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Drug Testing. In 1997, federal inmates were subject to 127,460 drug tests. Two percent of tests were positive, as compared to the 9 percent average for state correctional systems. Prisoners testing positive for drugs are appropriately punished and follow up tests are scheduled regularly to ensure they stay clean. Drug testing of correctional officers, and other selected employees is also an established policy in the Federal Bureau of Prisons.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications, such as those between government officials and their advisors. The information provided in the example does not fall under this category and would likely be subject to release under FOIA.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Drug Treatment. In compliance with the 1994 Crime Law, drug treatment is provided to 100 percent of eligible inmates prior to their release from Bureau custody. In FY 97, nearly 31,000 inmates participated in Bureau treatment programs. The number of institutions offering residential treatment has grown from 32 to 42 since FY I 994.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A. No. By law, states must develop and implement plans for drug testing and intervention as a condition of receiving federal prison construction grants. Today's action means that as part of those plans, states will need to add information on their existing prison drug use problem, and update that information annually. All 50 state correctional systems conducted some form of drug testing on their inmates last year; yet no comprehensive data exists on the prevalence on drug use in state prisons. Anecdotal reports have shown that certain systems, such as the District of Columbia's corrections department, have had difficulty keeping drugs out of prisons. The baseline information they provide will help us to chart states' progress to reduce drug use and availability in their prisons.	No, this statement does not appear to contain information that would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. It primarily discusses the need for states to provide information on their prison drug use problem as part of their plans for drug testing and intervention, and the lack of comprehensive data on the prevalence of drug use in state prisons. It does not appear to contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of government decision-making.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In order to provide additional resources for states to promote coerced abstinence and zero tolerance for drugs, the directive calls on the Attorney General to develop legislation to allow states to use their federal prison construction and treatment funds to carry out all of these activities.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The directive involves the Attorney General developing legislation, which could be considered part of the agency's deliberative process. However, the ultimate determination of whether this information is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances and context of the request.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In addition, the President is proposing $197 million in FY 99 for a series of initiatives to help states promote coerced abstinence and treatment: I) $85 million for a new drug testing, sanctions, and intervention program for states and local criminal justice systems; 2) $30 million for Drug Courts; 3) $4. 7 million for the federal Operation Drug Test program; 4) $5 million for a juvenile justice demonstration program to combat teen drug use; and 5) $72 million to continue the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment in State Prisons program.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q.

Are there tough penalties for trafficking drugs into federal prisons?	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications or deliberations. It is a straightforward question about penalties for drug trafficking in federal prisons.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A. Yes. The 1994 Omnibus Crime Act increased penalties for illegal drug use and smuggling drugs into Federal prisons. For instance, drug trafficking in Federal prisons can now lead to imprisonment for up to 20 years for smuggling narcotics and methamphetamine, and up to 5 years for trafficking marijuana.	No, this information does not fall under FOIA exemption 5, which pertains to privileged communications within or between agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials.

However, the following information may be helpful to you:; ; The FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The use of the word ""draft"" alone does not automatically qualify a document for exemption 5 protection. The content of the document and the context in which it was created are also important factors to consider. If the draft contains pre-decisional or deliberative information that is part of the agency's decision-making process, it may be protected under exemption 5. However, if the draft is simply a preliminary or incomplete version of a final document that will be released to the public, it may not be protected.

Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The memorandum would need to be evaluated in the context of the agency's decision-making process and whether it contains pre-decisional or deliberative information.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Crime rates in this country have dropped significantly for 5 years, and the number of Americans who have used drugs is down nearly 50% from its peak 15 years ago. Also, drug-related murders have dropped to their lowest point in a decade, and recent drug use surveys indicate that -- for the first time in years -- teen drug use is leveling off, and in some instances, modestly decreasing. All of this news is encouraging.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications, deliberations, or documents.
D0	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Nonetheless, much more can and needs to be done to continue to bring down drug use and increase public safety. With more than half the offenders in our criminal justice system estimated to have a substance abuse problem, enforcing coerced abstinence within the criminal justice system is critical to breaking the cycle of crime and drugs. My Administration consistently has promoted testing offenders and requiring treatment as a means of reducing recidivism and drug-related crime. We have worked to expand the number of Drug Courts throughout the country, increased the number of federal arrestees and prisoners who are tested and treated for drugs, and launched an innovative ""Breaking the Cycle"" initiative, which is a rigorous program of testing, treatment, supervision, and sanctions for offenders at all stages of the criminal justice process. And under your leadership, the Federal Bureau of Prisons provides models of excellence in drug detection, inmate testing, and drug treatment."	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We can do still more to enforce coerced abstinence among state prisoners, probationers, and parolees. When a drug user ends up in a state prison, we have a chance to break his or her addiction. Convicted offenders who undergo drug testing and treatment while incarcerated and after release are approximately twice as likely to stay drug- and crime-free as those offenders who do not receive testing and treatment. But when drug use inside prisons is ignored, the demand for drugs runs high. In this environment, correction officials struggle to keep their prisons drug-free. Often drugs are smuggled in by visitors; sometimes even by compromised correctional staff.
