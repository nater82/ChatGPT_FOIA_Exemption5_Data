The record described would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The record appears to be a communication between White House staff members discussing a draft proposal for a White House conference on education and other meetings with specific constituencies. The communication includes advice, recommendations, and opinions, which are typically protected under the deliberative process privilege. This privilege allows agencies to withhold records that would reveal the internal decision-making process of the agency. ; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that the deliberative process privilege protects communications that are part of the agency's decision-making process and that would reveal the agency's deliberations, thought processes, and recommendations. Another relevant case is Coastal States Gas Corp. v. DOE, 617 F.2d 854 (D.C. Cir. 1980), in which the D.C. Circuit held that the privilege applies to communications that are predecisional and deliberative, meaning that they were prepared in anticipation of a decision and contain opinions, recommendations, or advice. ; ; In this case, the record appears to be a predecisional communication between White House staff members discussing a draft proposal for a White House conference on education and other meetings with specific constituencies. The communication includes advice, recommendations, and opinions, which are protected under the deliberative process privilege.

Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 covers ""documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated."" The Court explained that the purpose of the exemption is to protect the ""quality of agency decisions"" by allowing officials to engage in frank and open discussions without fear of public disclosure. This rationale would apply to the record described, which appears to be part of the EOP's internal deliberations over drug policy and budget priorities."

While crime rates continue to drop and overall drug use is down, illegal drugs remain an enormous factor  behind  the level of crime and violence  in America.  Drug addicts are involved in approximately 3 to 5 times the  number of criminal  incidents as arrestees  who do not use drugs. Last week, Columbia University's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) released a study confirming the need for coerced abstinence and treatment in the criminal justice system. CASA's study found that 1.4 million offenders -- or 80% of the 1.7 million criminals in prison and jails -- were either high on drugs or alcohol when arrested, stole property to buy drugs, or have a history of drug and alcohol abuse.	It is unlikely that the above record would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This record appears to be a memo or email sent by a White House staffer to several other individuals, including Elena Kagan (who at the time was a White House counsel). While the record does not contain any explicit legal advice or attorney-client communications, it is possible that Kagan's inclusion on the email could be interpreted as seeking or providing legal advice. However, without more information about the context and purpose of the email, it is difficult to determine whether exemption 5 would apply.; ; One case that may be relevant is In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729 (D.C. Cir. 1997), which established a three-part test for determining whether a communication is protected by the attorney-client privilege. The test considers whether the communication (1) was made for the purpose of seeking or providing legal advice, (2) was made in confidence, and (3) was not disclosed to third parties. While this case dealt specifically with the attorney-client privilege rather than exemption 5, it provides a framework for analyzing whether a communication is privileged or protected from disclosure.

The court emphasized that the exemption is intended to protect the quality of agency decision-making by allowing officials to freely exchange ideas and opinions without fear of public disclosure. ; ; Similarly, if the communication in this record was part of a deliberative process or contained pre-decisional advice, it could be protected by exemption 5.

Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional, deliberative, and privileged. However, if the emails contain purely factual information or do not involve any deliberation or decision-making, they may not be protected under exemption 5. Additionally, if the emails contain information that is already publicly available or has been previously disclosed, they may not be protected under exemption 5.

The current immigration system is set up to favor keeping families intact. Thus, the vast number of legal immigrants are brought to this country through family-based visas, which do  not take into account education or skill level. The article cites a Rand  study proposal  to create a point system of immigration which continues to  give  weight  to  immediate  family  reunification but  would  also give points  for education, language  skills, and work experience. The final report of the Commission on Immigration Reform also recommends a shift  in priority toward  higher skilled immigrants.    Instead creating a point system, the Commission recommends revising skill-based admissions (approximately 100,000 visas) to favor highly-skilled and educated immigrants and eliminating altogether the category of unskilled workers. Though we think that these ideas are well worth exploring, it is unlikely that Congress will want to consider an overhaul of legal immigration this year. Efforts to reduce legal immigration levels were defeated during consideration of the 1996 illegal immigration law.

We have asked HI-IS to review the extent to which this is occurring. However, it is important to note that many independent policy experts believe that payments to HMOs still are, on average, excessive given the fact that they continue to attract disproportionately healthy populations.  They believe that any movement towards reducing 2 benefits are more attributable to HMO ' s desire for adequate profit margins for their investors rather than adjustments in reimbursement issue. In fact, one corporate executive just informed us that Medicare continues to be their number one most profitable player. Having said that, the fact that the BBA is starting to reduce Medicare reimbursements to HMOs will clearly contribute to lower revenues for these health plans. It is important to note that the added benefits in Medicare HMO plans do help encourage beneficiaries to participate in these plans. The outstanding question is whether or not we want to allow payment rates to exceed what is necessary so as to ensure that these additional benefits are in place.

We also need to keep up with the changes in the agricultural marketplace,  and in our diets.    For inst ance, there have been dramatic changes in the produce department of the grocery store.  Thirty  years  ago,  most  produce  sections only had around a dozen items year round, increasing to as many as 50 in the summer.  Today, the chances are that there are 400 or more items in  the produce  section  and  they are there all year round.   Last year, 38 percent of the fruit and 12 percent  of the vegetables Americans ate were imported .	The memorandum would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

Attached is a two-page draft summary of the OMB staff proposal. It would: reinforce and support current programs, like Title I, by mainly providing sizable money awards for demonstrated progress in raising student achievement, not just providing more money for more plans for the same things schools are supposed to be doing with Goals and title I and IDEA, etc.;; ; --=----------------- ATTACHMENT l ==================== ATT CREATION TIME/DATE: 0 00:00:00.00	"The record described would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged inter-agency or intra-agency communications. The record appears to be a communication between government officials discussing a proposed alternative approach to addressing educational achievement in high poverty areas. The communication includes draft proposals and discussions of ongoing programs, which could be considered part of the government's decision-making process. As such, it may be protected from disclosure under exemption 5. ; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 covers ""documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated."" The communication described in the record appears to fit within this definition."

It's a continuation of a previous meeting.  Key topics will be needle exchange and upcoming report of President's Council on HIV/AIDS.	"The text provided would likely not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are ""predecisional"" and ""deliberative"" in nature. However, the text provided does not appear to contain any such communications. Rather, it is a brief email discussing the logistics of a meeting and the topics that will be discussed. There is no indication that the email contains any predecisional or deliberative information. Therefore, it is unlikely that exemption 5 would apply.; ; There is no specific case law cited to support this conclusion, as the text provided is relatively straightforward and does not present any complex legal issues. However, the general principles underlying exemption 5 are well-established and have been applied in numerous cases. For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 protects ""documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated."" Similarly, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854 (D.C. Cir. 1980), the D.C. Circuit held that exemption 5 applies to ""documents that are both predecisional and deliberative, meaning that they reflect the give-and-take of the consultative process."" Based on these and other cases, it is clear that exemption 5 is intended to protect certain types of communications that are part of the decision-making process, but not all communications between government officials."

To help working families afford child care, the proposal: (1) increases funding for federal child care subsidies through the Child Care and Development Block Grant; and (2) changes the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit by raising the percentage of child care expenses  for which a  taxpayer may take a credit and by increasing the income levels of taxpayers who may  claim it. Currently, the credit rate is phased down from 30% for taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $10,000 or less to 20% for taxpayers with AGI above $28,000.  We are considering a series of options, including raising the credit rate from 50% for taxpayers with AGI of $30,000 to 20% for those with AGI above $59,000.)  We are also considering targeted investments to improve  the safety and quality of care.    First, the proposal adds funding to the scholarship program for child care providers, which you announced at the child care conference and  which has  received strong support. Second, it includes a new program that will ensure safety and healthy early learning and development for children in the critical first years. Third, the proposal provides resources for states to improve their enforcement of health and safety standards, and fourth, it funds parent education, research and technology. Finally, the proposal makes safe, constructive activities for youth during after-school hours more available by creating a new program for school age children and by coordinating existing programs.	The record described would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The record appears to be a communication between two officials within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) regarding a child care proposal. As such, it is likely that the communication would be considered privileged and therefore exempt from disclosure under exemption 5. ; ; This conclusion is supported by case law such as NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), which established that the deliberative process privilege protects communications that are part of the decision-making process within an agency. The privilege applies to communications that are predecisional and deliberative, meaning they are made before a final decision is reached and are intended to help shape that decision. The record described appears to be just such a communication, as it discusses options that are being considered as part of the child care proposal. ; ; Additionally, the fact that the record was created by an official within the EOP further supports the conclusion that it would be protected under exemption 5. The EOP is considered to be an extension of the President and is therefore entitled to a greater degree of confidentiality than other agencies. This was established in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), which held that the President's communications with his advisors are presumptively privileged and can only be overcome by a showing of need that outweighs the public interest in confidentiality. While the record described may not be a direct communication with the President, it was created by an official within the EOP and is therefore entitled to a similar degree of protection.

It is possible that this record could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, more information would be needed to make a definitive determination. The record appears to be a communication between various individuals within the Executive Office of the President, including the President's counsel and senior advisors. If the communication contains legal advice or other privileged information, it could be protected under exemption 5. However, if it is simply a routine administrative communication, it may not be protected. ; ; One case that could be relevant is In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729 (D.C. Cir. 1997), which established a three-part test for determining whether a document is protected under exemption 5. The test looks at whether the document is (1) predecisional, (2) deliberative, and (3) contains information that would be privileged in civil litigation. If the document meets all three criteria, it may be protected. However, the court noted that exemption 5 should be narrowly construed and that agencies should not use it to withhold information that is not truly privileged.

"The record described would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The record appears to be a communication between high-level officials in the Executive Office of the President, discussing a list of conservative individuals or groups. This communication could potentially be considered pre-decisional and deliberative, as it appears to be part of the process of developing a strategy or policy position. ; ; One case that supports this interpretation is Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2004). In that case, the D.C. Circuit held that a memorandum from a White House counsel to the President, discussing legal advice and recommendations, was protected under exemption 5 as pre-decisional and deliberative. The court noted that the memorandum was ""part of the consultative process by which the President obtains the advice of his closest advisors"" and that disclosure would ""chill the candor and limit the range of information and advice provided to the President."" Similarly, the communication described in the record appears to be part of a consultative process among high-level officials, and disclosure could similarly chill candor and limit the range of information and advice provided."

DOE and my preference is to release the  report, however we can, this week. Pena and key Asst. Secretary are available Friday and MAY be available Thursday. Barry Toiv is now working to get closure in the press office. If this comes  up again, please let people know we need to get it out the door. We just need 2 days notice to  get to advisory committee members, certain reporters, and key Hill people if we want to get any decent press and not offend anyone. Since 7 agencies are involved, outreach can't be done at very last minute. Thanks for your help.

He asked ACHRE to uncover the truth, recommend ways to right past wrongs, and suggest ways to make sure the government will not repeat past mistakes.

The text provided does not appear to be an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letter, but rather a record of a communication between individuals within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) and possibly outside parties. Therefore, exemption 5 would not apply. ; ; Case law: In National Labor Relations Board v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 only applies to inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.

Reed/OPD/EOP, Elena Kagan/OPD/EOP cc: Subject: Need for Closure on Radiation Report Release Date; ; Io October, 1995 ACHRE issued its report. ACHRE found that the-government had conducted several thousand human radiation experiments from 1945 to 1975 and that the majority advanced biomedical research. The Committee found, however, that some were conducted unethically. For example, scientists injected plutonium into 18 patients without their knowledge, and researchers conducted experiments on indigent patients and children. ACHRE made 18 recommendations to open the public record, protect human subjects of future research, and compensate those wronged by the government's actions.	"The text would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The text appears to be a communication between two officials within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) discussing the release date of a radiation report. This communication could be considered privileged because it involves internal deliberations and decision-making within the EOP. ; ; There is no specific case law cited in the text to support this conclusion, but courts have generally interpreted exemption 5 broadly to protect the decision-making process within agencies. For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975), the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 covers ""intra-agency memorandums which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" ; ; Therefore, unless there is a compelling public interest in disclosure that outweighs the need for confidentiality, this communication would likely be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5."

ACHRE recommended that subjects of secret experiments have special protections and information. Acting on that recommendation, the President directed agencies today to propose new rules for secret research that would require scientists to: obtain informed consent from all potential subjects of all secret experiments (current rules allow researchers to waive informed consent in certain cases); disclose the identity of the sponsoring agency to potential subjects; and tell potential subjects that an experiment is classified. The new rules would also establish a more independent review process; require the head of the agency conducting secret human research to approve each project; and require permanent records of secret experiments. The President also directed federal agencies to report annually on the number of classified human research projects and the number of subjects in each project. A preliminary review by the Administration's human radiation lnteragency Working Group indicates that the government is not supporting any classified human research at this time; today's directive initiates a formal, routine accounting of secret human studies.

The administration also said it has settled the last of a number of claims, totalling $6.5 million, from families of civilians who were injected with plutonium or uranium as part of secret experiments in the 1940s. The actions are• • designed to increase public trust ... and make our government accountable to the American people,"" said Energy Secretary Federico Pena, whose department has spearheaded the public review of past radiation experiments. Pena said the administration also will ask Congress to expand a program that provides compensation to uranium miners who were exposed to radiation as part of the government nuclear weapons program. He said up to 600 additional miners would be compensated at a cost of about $ 50 million. The plans for giving greater protection to research participants were prompted by recommendations more than a year ago by a presidential commission that investigated the government's use of humans in radiation research during the Cold War years. The advisory panel warned that past excesses might be repeated unless there are new safeguards. The White House said today that Clinton had signed a memorandum ,; strengthening the rights and protections afforded individuals who agree to be subjects of secret, government-supported research. The White House said a review by an interagency task force uncovered no government-supported classified human research at this time. But officials acknowledged that formal accounting for such research needs to be improved. Meanwhile, the White House said it had settled claims with four additional families of 1B individuals who were given plutonium injections as part of 1940s experiments. One victim has not been located and the family of another does not want compensation, said Tara O'Toole, DOE's assistant secretary for environment, safety and health. Associate  Attorney  General  John Dwyer  said the 16 claims        12 of which  totalling  $4.B million  were  made  public last November  total $6.5 million. The government has said it is prepared to provide compensation to the families of 52 other individuals who the advisory commission said were believed to be subjected to improper radiation experiments. The identity of those 52 are not known, and so far no families have come forward, according to the White House. Under the new presidential directive on human research, agencies must develop new rules that clearly require scientists to obtain informed consent from all potential subjects of secret experiments. Currently, such consent may be waived under some circumstances. The president also ordered that any research subject be told the identity of the sponsoring agency and whether the experimentation is classified. The new rules also would require the head of the agency to approve such research and develop a more independent review process than currently provided. Also in response to the October 1995 findings by the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, the president said he will: Ask Congress to broaden a 1990 law that allows compensation to underground uranium miners who became ill because of exposure to radiation. Under current law, hundreds of miners are ineligible for compensation. Will propose legislation to make veterans' health care benefits available to airmen and sailors who were subjects of radioactive nasal treatments more than 50 years ago. The treatments were to prevent broken eardrums during flight or in submarines. Will seek broader epidemiological studies to determine the long-term health impact of nuclear bomb testing during the Cold War to military personnel and civilian populations near the test areas.

All these efforts at political reform, it seems to me, are important.

According to ACHRE's chair, Dr. Ruth  Faden, expanded  compensation for uranium miners is one of the most strongly-felt of ACHRE's recommendations.	The memorandum would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged inter-agency or intra-agency communications. The memorandum is a communication between two members of the Domestic Policy Council, which is an intra-agency communication. Additionally, the memorandum contains advice and recommendations regarding a policy decision, which is likely covered by the deliberative process privilege. This privilege protects communications that are part of the decision-making process and that contain opinions, recommendations, or advice. ; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that the deliberative process privilege protects communications that are part of the decision-making process and that contain opinions, recommendations, or advice. Another case that supports this conclusion is Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854 (D.C. Cir. 1980), in which the D.C. Circuit held that the deliberative process privilege protects communications that are part of the decision-making process and that contain opinions, recommendations, or advice.

The above memorandum would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The memorandum appears to be an internal communication within the Domestic Policy Council, discussing a decision that needs to be made regarding proposed changes to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). The content of the memorandum appears to be deliberative in nature, discussing the appropriateness of a recommendation made by the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) to expand compensation for individuals affected by radiation exposure without requiring individualized proof of causation. The memorandum discusses the reasoning behind this recommendation, including the egregiousness of the government's conduct, the impact of increased cancer rates in affected communities, and the government's failure to take reasonable steps to reduce known risks.; ; The deliberative nature of the memorandum would likely qualify it for exemption 5 protection, as it reflects the internal decision-making process of the agency and contains opinions, recommendations, and advice that are part of that process. The memorandum is not a final agency action or a factual record, but rather a communication that is part of the agency's decision-making process. As such, it would likely be protected from disclosure under exemption 5.; ; Case law that supports this conclusion includes NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), which established that exemption 5 covers communications that are part of the agency's decision-making process and that reflect the agency's deliberative process. The Supreme Court has also held that exemption 5 covers communications that are predecisional and deliberative, and that would be subject to disclosure if they were made after the agency's decision had been made. See United States v. Weber Aircraft Corp., 465 U.S. 792 (1984). In this case, the memorandum appears to be predecisional and deliberative, and would likely be protected under exemption 5.

Under RECA, people living downwind  of certain areas are compensated  ($50,000) if they  get  a radiogenic disease--even though the probability is very low (<10%) that the disease  was caused by the government's action. In addition, because RECA is not currently based on a probabilistic standard, a significant number of uranium miners who fall within the 20%-50% probability range in Option A are already eligible for compensation.  Option  A  would overcome some of these inequities.	The memorandum would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The memorandum does not contain pre-decisional or deliberative information, but rather presents a proposal for a policy change and discusses the current inequities in the existing policy. As such, it does not fall within the scope of exemption 5. There is no need to cite case law to support this conclusion.

Second, the President announced that children of veterans  exposed  to agent orange  will  be compensated  with medical care if they are born with spina bifida. This decision  was tnade despite the extremely low probability of a connection and in the absence of biological plausibility. ·	"The memorandum would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged inter-agency or intra-agency communications. The memorandum is an internal communication within the Domestic Policy Council and contains advice and recommendations regarding proposed changes to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA).

"The information in this memorandum would likely not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.

Rather, it appears to contain factual information about the cost estimates of proposed changes to RECA. ; ; Case law supports this conclusion. In Coastal States Gas Corp. v.

Reilly Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal NEW YORK - Golden Books Family Entertainment, the struggling children's book publisher, was dealt another blow as its president and second-in-<:ommand, Eric Ellenbogen, resigned unexpectedly to take a job as president and chief executive officer of Marvel Enterprises Inc. Mr. Ellenbogen, 41 years old, came to the company in 1996 as president of its entertainment group, a television and video-based unit. In June, he was named president of the entire company, acting as No. 2 to Richard E. Snyder, the parent's 65-year-old chairman and chief executive. At Marvel, he succeeds Joseph Ahearn, who previously said he would resign as soon as a successor was named. Marvel Enterprises was created in October when Marvel Entertainment Group Inc. emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and merged with Toy Biz Inc. It owns the rights to several comic-book characters including ""Spidennan,"" 11X-Men"" and ""Men in Black,"" as well as Fleer/Skybox, a trading-card maker, and the Panini stickers business. Mr. Ellenbogen was credited with building Broadway Video, a television production and distribution company, which Golden Books acquired in 1996. He directed Broadway's acquisition of crucial film and television libraries, including titles such as ""Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" and ""Lassie."" The company said Mr. Snyder now will directly oversee the entertainment unit, which includes home video, merchandising and licensing. Golden Books' nine-month net loss widened sharply to $70.3 million, or $2.77 a share, and revenue fell to $142 million from $ f70 million. It recently reached a preliminary standstill agreement with a group of bondholders to put off interest payments on $100 million in debt. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Golden Books said there is ""substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern."" The company has warned that possible ""restructuring, reduction of costs and other actions"" could result in substantial year-end charges. Earlier this month, it was notified by the Nasdaq Stock Market about the possible delisting of the company's stock for failure to maintain a closing price of at least $5. The shares could be delisted . as early as Dec. 11, though the company says it plans to ""work with the Nasdaq"" to ensure its continued listing. Shares of Golden Books fell 6.25 cents to 43.75 cents in Nasdaq trading, close to a 52-week low. Marvel rose 6.25 cents to $5.9375 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading. Golden Books said Mr. Ellenbogen won't be replaced and said it will be ""streamlining"" its organization. The company said it will be ""finalizing"" its senior management in the next several weeks."

As confidence  continued after the recent financial turmoil, problem-plagued ftanchis marketing company Cendant Corp. sold $1.55 billion ofbon increasing the size from a planned $500 million in response t strong investor demand. In addition, two telecommunications companies sold junk-rated securities to finance the construction new networks. Level 3 Communications Inc., which is using Internet technology, came to market with $500 million of zero-coupon bonds, while Global Crossing Holdings Ltd. sold $500 million of preferred stock to help finance its international fiber-optic links. Despite the rush, there is little sign the current flood of bond issuance will ease. It emerged yesterday that the Seagram Co. is lining up a giant debt offering, likely to come to market in December. Lead manager Goldman, Sachs & Co. is marketing the deal at a size of $2 billion. But there is widespread expectation among people looking at the transaction that the total could be raised to $2.5 billion to $4 billion. Goldman declined to comment on whether the size would be increased. No official confirmation of the use of proceeds was available. However Montreal-based Seagram is completing its acquisition of entertainment company PolyGrarn NV. The acquisition is valued in excess of$10 billion and is expected  to close  Dec. 4. With issuance rapidly making up any ground lost in September and early October, worries about a credit crunch are easing, though some participants say the real test will come after Thanksgiving with Seagram's deal and the $2.5 billion anticipated from Monsanto Co., announced two weeks ago. ""The supply overhang that we saw all year is coming to the market and deals are getting done,"" said Greg Hahn, senior vice president and fixed-income portfolio manager at Conseco Capital Management. ""That's a very healthy sign for the market  right now."" The key to Cendant's deal was the high yield on offer, according to investors. That helped to overcome worries about the accounting scandal that has plagued the company this year. ""Obviously  the company has had its accounting problems, but you can't  beat"" the yield on offer relative to Treasurys, said John Kowalik, senior vice president and portfolio manager at Oppenheimer Funds. ""If you're a yield  buyer, this would qualify as a candidate."" Lead underwriters Chase Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co. said that even at the increased size, demand outstripped  the bonds available.   The company so/d $400 million of two-year notes at a yield 2.875 percentage points more than comparable Treasurys and $1.15 billion of five-year notes at a yield 3.125 percentage points more than Treasurys.    During the four-day roadshow to market the bond deal, syndicate officials said Cendant focused on the strength of its core businesses and strategy. For much of this year, the company's public image has been beset by an accounting scandal that took place at direct marketer CUC International, which merged with HFS Inc. to form Cendant in late 1997. As a further enticement, Cendant  will increase the coupon on the bond deal by 1.5 percentage points if its ratings are downgraded to junk status by both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's. Currently it is rated Baal by Moody's and triple-B by S&P. In the junk market, Global Crossing's offering of senior exchangeable pay-in-kind preferred securities was doubled from its originally planned size. The securities were priced at par with a 10.5% dividend rate. Level 3's deal was its second offering this year. It sold $3 billion of junk bonds in April and these securities have become a market favorite. During the financial crisis of mid-August to mid-October, ""Level 3 became the only bond you could sell because it was a high-yield benchmark,"" said Jerry Paul, high-yield fund manager Invesco Funds Group, ""and it was knocked down unduly."" Level 3, which has a $10 billion capital plan, ""saw a nice window to get some funds and got the money,"" said one person familiar with the deal. Neither Level 3 officials nor lead underwriter Salomon Smith Barney would comment. Here are the details of yesterday's two-year note auction.

Adler 03/17/99 02:38:51 PM Record Type:    Record To: Laura Emmett/WHO/EOP cc: Subject: nursing home meeting; ; SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION The proposed legislation would give DOJ three new tools to combat the failure of nursing homes and other residential health care facilities to treat residents properly. First, it creates criminal sanctions for organizations or individuals who knowingly and willfully engage  in a pattern of  physical  or mental harm to residents. Second, it would create civil penalties that could be imposed on individuals, facility chains, or management companies if they engage in conduct that results in a pattern of  physical  or mental harm to residents. Third,  it would authorize  DOJ to seek injunctive  relief  against these entities or individuals whenever DOJ has reason to suspect  that  they are engaging  in behavior  that  will  result in harm to physical or mental harm to residents. DOJ would have to consult  with HHS before invoking  its injunctive authority.	The above record would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are privileged. This record does not appear to be an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letter, but rather a summary of proposed legislation. Additionally, there is no indication that any privilege applies to this record. Therefore, it should be subject to disclosure under FOIA.; ; There is no specific case law cited to support this conclusion, as it is a straightforward application of the FOIA exemption 5 criteria.

Adler 03/17/99 02:38:51 PM Record Type:    Record To: Laura Emmett/WHO/EOP cc: Subject: nursing home meeting; ; OUTSTANDING ISSUES HHS is primarily concerned about the overlap in enforcement  authority  that these  new provisions would create. As currently drafted, the only area of facility noncompliance that would not pose the problem of overlapping authority for both agencies would be those cases where violations are minimal  or where the harm to residents is isolated. HHS is concerned  that  in situations  where both agencies have an interest in initiating an enforcement action, DOJ will push HCFA to delay its enforcement action, since DOJ's need  to build a solid case for conviction  may not coincide  with  HCFA's  need to act swiftly when needed. In addition, HHS is concerned that  DOJ  will develop  its own quality standards for individual facilities and chains when deciding whether to initiate prosecution, thus requiring facilities to comply with one set of standards developed by HCFA  and another  set of standards developed by DOJ.	"The passage would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged inter- or intra-agency communications. The passage appears to be an internal communication between HHS officials discussing concerns about potential conflicts between HHS and DOJ enforcement actions related to nursing homes. The communication reflects the agencies' deliberative process and contains opinions and recommendations that are likely protected from disclosure under exemption 5. ; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 covers ""documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated."" Another relevant case is Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Dep't of Energy, 617 F.2d 854 (D.C. Cir. 1980), which held that exemption 5 covers communications that are ""predecisional"" and ""deliberative"" in nature, meaning they were created before a final decision was made and contain opinions or recommendations that were part of the decision-making process."

Adler 03/17/99 02:38:51 PM Record Type:    Record To: Laura Emmett/WHO/EOP cc: Subject: nursing home meeting; ; DOJ feels that the overlap in enforcement authority is limited to enforcement action in individual facilities. Currently, no one has the authority to prosecute nursing home chains for repeated violations, which this statute would provide to DOJ. In addition, this policy would not preclude  HHS from taking any action to protect the health and safety of residents, and DOJ is willing to codify this in an MOU.	"The text would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would be privileged in civil litigation. The text appears to be a communication between two government officials discussing the DOJ's position on a proposed statute related to nursing home enforcement. The text contains opinions and recommendations regarding the proposed statute, which would likely be considered deliberative in nature. ; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 protects ""recommendations, draft documents, proposals, suggestions, and other subjective documents which reflect the personal opinions of the writer rather than the policy of the agency."" The text in question contains recommendations and opinions, and therefore would likely be protected under exemption 5."

Adler 03/17/99 02:38:51 PM Record Type:    Record To: Laura Emmett/WHO/EOP cc: Subject: nursing home meeting; ; PROPOSED DPC POSITION Modify the DOJ proposal to limit their new enforcement authority to criminal violations and require HHS to propose new legislation providing the111 with new authority to impose civil penalties. Under this option, the Department of Justice would be allowed to impose new criminal penalties on individuals, facility chains, and management companites who knowingly and willfully engage in a patterns of physical or mental harm to residents. HHS would propose new  legislation creating civil penalties that could be imposed on individuals,  facility chains, or management  companies if they engage in conduct that results in a pattern of physical or mental harm to residents. This compromise provides virtually the same level of enforcement and eliminates the problematic overlap of authority created by the DOJ proposal.	The proposed DPC position would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The proposed position does not fall under this exemption because it does not involve communication between agencies or within an agency.

During the late 1980s, many states established financing schemes that had the effect of increasing their Federal Medicaid funds without using additional state resources. Typically, states would raise funds from health care providers (through provider taxes or ""donations""), then pay back those providers through increased Medicaid payments. Since the Federal government pays at least half of Medicaid payments, the provider taxes or donations would be repaid in large part by Federal matching payments. Using this mechanism, the state was left with a net gain because it only had to repay part of the provider tax or donation it originally received.  This led to an unprecedented drain on the Federal Treasury - the major reason why Federal Medicaid costs more than doubled between 1988 and 1992."

Despite the new law and the regulations, many states continued to use provider taxes that at least appeared to be out of compliance. To date, these possibly impermissible taxes total an estimated $2 to 4 billion and, in the future, will cost billions more. In response, HCFA issued letters and discussed its concerns about certain taxes with states, but -- for a variety of reasons -- never took any final action (called a ""disallowance""). Unfortunately, this has meant that a number of states have continued using these taxes, believing that HCFA might never enforce the law, or that if they did, they could seek recourse through the White House or the Congress. (In fact, since we do not have a good track record on enforcement, budget examiners at CBO and in the Administration have already written off Federal revenue raised through these provider taxes; this is important to know since it means we could waive past ""abuses"" retrospectively and it might not be scored as a cost.)"

To ensure that New York would never be vulnerable to Medicaid provider tax enforcement actions, Senator Moynihan and Senator D' Amato successfully added a provision to the Balanced Budget Act to exempt all of its provider taxes (it has dozens), both retrospectively and prospectively, from disallowances. Both in writing and orally we repeatedly objected to this provision. Moreover, we provided alternative statutory language that would have addressed about two-thirds (over $ I billion worth) of the problem. As you know, however, the Senators (through their staff) rejected our offer and insisted on their original provisions.

In announcing the line-item veto on August 11, we raised concerns about the cost and ramifications of singling out as permissible one state's provider taxes. Although our actions were generally viewed as responsible and defensible by those who know the program and/or who are budget experts, the same clearly cannot be said of New York's political establishment. The Governor's office, the New York Congressional delegation, the Mayor, providers and unions reacted strongly and negatively to the veto.  Among a host of complaints, they charged that they were singled out and were never made aware that this provision could be subject to the line item veto.

(Nine other states who are in one of the top two categories will get similar requests.) For these states, we simply do not have sufficient information to determine the legality of at least some of their taxes.

The follow up to these letters will be, we hope, immediate discussions between HCFA and the states. Our primary goal is to protect the Federal Treasury prospectively.

Very few of the states who receive notices will be pleased. For example, although HCFA is relieving approximately two-thirds of New York's past impermissible tax claims (worth over $1 billion), there is still at least $500 million in taxes that HCFA probably cannot consider legal.

The subject matter of the communication, an article on Medicaid, suggests that it may contain policy advice or recommendations, which are typically considered privileged.; ; However, without more information about the content of the document and the specific privilege being asserted, it is difficult to say for certain whether exemption 5 applies. For example, if the document contains purely factual information or if the privilege being asserted is not recognized under FOIA case law, exemption 5 may not apply.; ; One case that may be relevant is United States v. Nixon, in which the Supreme Court recognized a qualified executive privilege for certain communications between the President and his advisors. However, the scope of this privilege is limited and must be balanced against the public interest in disclosure. Other cases, such as In re Sealed Case and Judicial Watch v. Department of Justice, have further clarified the scope of exemption 5 and the types of privileges that may be asserted.; ; Overall, whether the above document is protected under exemption 5 will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case, as well as the legal arguments made by the agency asserting the privilege.

It does not:(!) prevent health plans in the individual market from denying coverage on the basis of genetic information; (2) assure that premiums settings are in no way based on genetic information both in the group and individual market; and (3) prevent health plans from disclosing genetic information to insurers, to plan sponsors, and other entities regulated by state insurance laws, such as life, disability, and long-term care insurers."

Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; PREVENTING INSURANCE DISCRIMINATION BASED ON GENETIC INFORMATION; ; State laws are insufficient. Nineteen states have already enacted laws to restrict the use of genetic information in health insurance and many others have introduced legislation. However, state legislation is insufficient to solve this problem. First, private sector employer sponsored health plans, which cover half of all Americans, are exempt from state insurance laws due to ERISA preemption. Second, current state laws generally focus on genetic tests rather than a broader definition of genetic information such as family history, medical records, and physical exams. Finally, the variability among state bills will lead to a lack of uniformity across the nation as to whether and how genetic information may be used by health plans.	"The passage would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are typically covered by this exemption.

"The statement ""PREVENTING INSURANCE DISCRIMINATION BASED ON GENETIC INFORMATION"" would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not fall under any of the categories of information that are exempted under this provision. FOIA exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and attorney work product. However, the statement ""POTENTIAL GENETIC SCREENING EVENTS"" may be protected under FOIA exemption 5 if it is part of an inter-agency or intra-agency communication that meets the criteria for exemption. For example, if the statement is part of a confidential memo or email exchange between government officials discussing the potential use of genetic screening in a particular program or policy, it may be exempted under the deliberative process privilege. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine whether this statement would be exempted under FOIA exemption 5. ; ; Case law: In Milner v.

They are proposing an event that would take place at the National Academy of Sciences, which would include remarks by a few of their members and a couple of victims of genetic discrimination and the President or Vice President. NAS holds about 600 people. If we want a specific event for this, they are willing to design it as a legislative conference -- which would be appropriate since they too are about ready to announce their support of the Slaughter legislation.	It is unlikely that the above statement would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

Apparently, there is a new gene discovery on a well-known late adulthood disease that is potentially being announced in the next month in Science magazine. Science has not decided when they will publish this gene, although there is fairly good chance they will publish it in late June or early July:  They will be able to notify us between two and three weeks before publication. When they do publish, the Human Genome Institute plans to do a press conference on the discovery. This event -- could highlight the discovery and then emphasize that as we make these new breakthroughs on genetics, we should enact legislation to ensure that this genetic information is not used to discriminate against people. (Even if we do not want to use this to highlight the genetic screening legislation, we may want to consider some possible POTUS involvement). This event is not necessarily mutually exclusive from the event with the Genome Action Plan.	The information regarding the potential gene discovery and the plans for a press conference to announce it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process, and that would not be available to the public otherwise. However, the information in this scenario does not involve any such communication. Rather, it is a discussion of a potential event and plans for a press conference. Additionally, the discussion does not involve any deliberative process or decision-making. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law that directly applies to this scenario.

Total 1998 cocaine seizures are projected to be less than half of the annual average seized between 1991 and 1996 and account for just a fifth of the cocaine crossing the border. Heroin seizures have declined by about a third since 1996. Over the past several years, the general trend has been one of fewer seizures of all drugs except marijuana.

The purpose of exemption 5 is to encourage frank and open communication within agencies by protecting the confidentiality of these deliberative documents.; ; In the case of NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., the Supreme Court established a two-part test for determining whether a document is protected under exemption 5.

Second, the document must be deliberative, meaning that it contains opinions, recommendations, or advice that are intended to inform or influence the decision-maker.; ; Applying this test to the memorandum in question, it appears that the document may be protected under exemption 5. The memorandum is addressed to the President, who is the ultimate decision-maker on drug control efforts along the Southwest border. The recommendations and advice contained in the memorandum are intended to inform and influence the President's decision-making process. Therefore, the memorandum is both predecisional and deliberative, and may be protected under exemption 5.; ; However, it is important to note that exemption 5 is not an absolute privilege.

For the last three years, the many federal agencies involved in law enforcement, commerce and transportation along our border have been engaged in a process to determine how we can best fulfill these anti-drug imperatives. The Attorney General and the Secretaries of State, Treasury, Commerce, Defense, and Transportation, and the leadership of the DEA, the Border Patrol, Customs, and the INS have been integral to this effort.  Our common  response is to create a Southwest Border Counter-Drug White Paper for approval by the President during the fall of 1998.	"The concept for analysis would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged inter-agency or intra-agency communications. The language in the passage suggests that the federal agencies involved in the counter-drug effort have been engaged in a collaborative process to develop a strategy, and that the resulting white paper will be presented to the President for approval. This suggests that the document is likely an inter-agency communication that contains pre-decisional deliberations and recommendations, which are typically protected under exemption 5.; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v.

Exemption 5 protects from disclosure ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" This exemption is often used to protect pre-decisional and deliberative documents, such as drafts, recommendations, and opinions.; ; In this case, the concept for analysis could be considered a pre-decisional document that contains recommendations and opinions about how to organize counter-drug efforts along the Southwest Border. The document may also contain internal deliberations and discussions among agency officials. As such, it could be argued that the document falls under the protection of exemption 5.; ; However, whether or not the document is protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case. For example, if the document has already been finalized and implemented, it may not be considered pre-decisional and therefore not protected under exemption 5. Additionally, if the document contains purely factual information that is not deliberative in nature, it may not be protected under exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses whether a concept for analysis organizing counter-drug efforts along the Southwest Border would be protected under exemption 5. However, there are numerous cases that have applied exemption 5 to similar types of documents, such as internal agency memoranda and recommendations. For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 protected internal agency memoranda that contained recommendations and opinions about how to handle a particular case."

However, the Court also noted that the privilege is not absolute and must be balanced against the public interest in disclosure.; ; In this case, the public interest in disclosure would likely depend on the importance of the Southwest Border process and the extent to which the memorandum sheds light on the decision-making process within the executive branch. If the memorandum contains information that is critical to understanding the government's approach to border security or immigration policy, for example, the public interest in disclosure may outweigh any potential harm to the deliberative process. On the other hand, if the memorandum is simply a routine internal communication that does not reveal anything significant about government decision-making, the privilege may be more likely to apply.

The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. Specifically, it could be argued that the statement falls under the deliberative process privilege, which protects communications that are part of the decision-making process and contain opinions, recommendations, or advice. ; ; In this case, the statement appears to be discussing internal discussions and planning within the executive branch regarding a policy proposal. The mention of concerns and the need to clarify them suggests that this is part of the deliberative process. Additionally, the fact that the meeting was scheduled at Rubin's request and involves communication between different agencies further supports the argument that this is a privileged communication.; ; Case law that supports this conclusion includes NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975), which established the deliberative process privilege as a valid exemption under FOIA. Other cases, such as Coastal States Gas Corp. v.

The purpose of this exemption is to protect the decision-making process and encourage frank and open discussions within the government.; ; To determine whether the information in question would be protected under exemption 5, it would depend on the specific nature and content of the information.

For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co.

In another case, EPA v.

Summary Inadequate dredging of the channels and berthing  areas serving  the Port of  New  York  and New Jersey, and the lack of leadership to solve the problem, have caused several major port companies to announce that they may  relocate their hub operations to Halifax,  Nova Scotia, or to other U.S. ports. Company decisions are expected in June or July. Fearful of job losses to Canada, the longshoremen have focused pressure to resolve dredging  issues on  Governors Pataki and Whitman. Concurrently, concern about disposal of contaminated dredged  material off New Jersey's coast has prompted Governor Whitman to criticize the  Administration's disposal policies as environmentally unsound. Her message has been lauded and reinforced by environmental groups and New Jersey shore communities, but it has further impeded needed dredging.	The memorandum may be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

We understand  that Governor  Whitman  is planning  a press conference on June 6 to announce the start of dredging, but port companies and unions remain highly skeptical. A visible, credible signal is therefore still needed to persuade the unions, port companies, and state governments that the  Administration  is  ready  to  get dredging moving as soon  as the states do their  part. We also  must  disarm  possible criticism on the environmental issues. Thus, the initiative  proposed  here is in  large  measure preemptive: we are increasing pressure on Whitman and Pataki to make tough decisions about local disposal options while protecting the President from  blame  either  for  imminent  job losses or for potential harm to the oceans. At  the same  time,  we  must  take care  not  to suggest too much Federal ""ownership"" of a problem that  inherently  must stay  on  the governors' doorsteps.

Therefore, even if the memorandum is protected under exemption 5, it may still be subject to disclosure if the public interest in transparency outweighs the government's interest in confidentiality.

The memorandum would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The memorandum appears to be a communication between high-level officials within different agencies, discussing a policy recommendation and the consultation process with outside stakeholders.

Another relevant case is Public Citizen Health Research Group v. FDA, 704 F.2d 1280 (D.C.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Summary; ;     • The Mud Dump Site (MDS): A dredge  material  disposal  site offshore  but  near Pallone's district. Federal law and policy now allows  disposal  of  category  I  and category 2 dredge material  at  this site.  (Category  I  is clean;  category  2 passes  tests but has some contamination; category 3 is not suitable for disposal in the ocean.) Governor Whitman has pledged not  to  put category  2 in  the  ocean,  and  that  pledge has been strongly endorsed by environmental groups and  shore  newspapers,  but there  are very few alternatives for category 2 disposal in the short  term.  Our  initiative proposed a decision by January 31, 1997 concerning the phase out of the Mud Dump Site, with the consideration of the alternatives for disposal.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. Specifically, if there were internal discussions or deliberations within the government about the Mud Dump Site and its disposal practices, those communications could be considered privileged and exempt from FOIA disclosure. However, if the information is simply a summary of publicly available information and does not reveal any internal government communications, it would not be protected under exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law cited in this scenario, so it is difficult to determine whether exemption 5 would apply. However, there have been cases where courts have upheld exemption 5 for internal government deliberations related to environmental policy. For example, in Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the court found that certain internal communications related to a proposed dam project were protected under exemption 5 because they were part of the agency's decision-making process.

This is a proposed rule revising  the regulations  governing how and when to test for contamination  in dredge material.    A New Jersey federal court opinion argues that EPA's technical manuals conflict with its underlying regulation -- rendering permits legally vulnerable. Environmentalists have derided EPA's rule as a ""rollback""  of ocean protection. Unions and port operators want the rule finalized as soon as possible, believing the rule change essential if permits to dispose material at the MDS are to survive court challenges. Our initiative proposed EPA action on the rule by August 1, I 996."	"The information provided in the summary would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

Additionally, FOIA exemption 5 only applies if the information would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. In this case, the court opinion is publicly available and therefore would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. There is no case law cited in the summary to support a different conclusion."

Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975), in which the Supreme Court established the ""deliberative process privilege"" as a component of exemption 5. This privilege protects communications that are part of the decision-making process within an agency, as opposed to purely factual information.

"It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The negotiations between Torricelli and Pallone, as well as their discussions with environmental groups, could potentially fall under the deliberative process privilege, which protects pre-decisional communications that are part of the agency's decision-making process. However, it would depend on the specific content of the communications and whether they meet the requirements for exemption 5 protection.; ; One case that could be relevant is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), which established the deliberative process privilege as a valid exemption under FOIA. The Court held that the privilege applies to documents that are both pre-decisional and deliberative, meaning they reflect the agency's thought processes and are not simply factual or purely administrative in nature. The Court also noted that the privilege is not absolute and must be balanced against the public interest in disclosure.; ; Another case that could be relevant is Coastal States Gas Corp. v. DOE, 617 F.2d 854 (D.C. Cir. 1980), which clarified that the privilege applies to communications that are ""intra-agency"" as well as those between agencies. The Court held that the purpose of the privilege is to protect the quality of agency decision-making by allowing officials to freely exchange ideas and opinions without fear of public scrutiny.

Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Summary; ; Recommendation	It is not possible to determine whether the summary and recommendation would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 without additional information about the content and context of the documents. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The exemption is intended to protect the decision-making process of government agencies by allowing for frank and candid discussions among officials. However, the exemption is not absolute and may be subject to a balancing test between the public interest in disclosure and the government's interest in withholding the information. Therefore, the determination of whether the summary and recommendation would be protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific content and context of the documents.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Summary; ; We recommend that the Administration make a counter-proposal to Pallone and  Torricelli, with the following elements:	The given statement may be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and deliberative process privilege. The statement appears to involve internal deliberations and recommendations made by the Administration, which may be considered part of the deliberative process privilege. However, the specific details and context of the statement would need to be examined to determine if it meets the requirements for exemption 5.; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), which established the two-part test for determining whether a document is protected under the deliberative process privilege. The test requires that the document be both predecisional and deliberative in nature. If the document meets these criteria, it may be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Summary; ;     • We would immediately begin  administrative  action  to close  the MDS  to category  2 at the end I997. This action would require a public proposal (this summer), a comment period, and a final  decision  (early  I997).  We  would  make  the  proposal and indicate our intention to close the  site,  but  would  not  pre-judge  the  final outcome of this process.	The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be an internal communication discussing potential administrative action and decision-making processes, which would likely fall under the deliberative process privilege. This privilege protects communications that are part of the decision-making process and are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. ; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that the deliberative process privilege protects communications that are part of the agency's decision-making process and are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. Another relevant case is Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854 (D.C. Cir. 1980), in which the D.C.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Summary; ;     • We would insist that the MDS be available as necessary until the end of 1997 for disposal of category 1 and 2 material. This  may  require  an  increase  in elevation  at the site.	"The statement may be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. Specifically, it may fall under the deliberative process privilege, which protects pre-decisional communications that are part of the agency's decision-making process and would reveal the agency's decision-making rationale or thought process if disclosed. ; ; In this case, the statement appears to be a recommendation or proposal regarding the disposal of certain materials, which suggests that it was part of an ongoing decision-making process. Additionally, the use of the word ""insist"" implies that there may have been some debate or disagreement within the agency about the best course of action, further supporting the argument that the statement is part of the deliberative process. ; ; One case that supports this conclusion is Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854 (D.C. Cir. 1980), which held that the deliberative process privilege protects ""recommendations, draft documents, proposals, suggestions, and other subjective documents which reflect the personal opinions of the writer rather than the policy of the agency."" ; ; However, it is important to note that the exemption is not absolute and may be overcome if the public interest in disclosure outweighs the government's interest in withholding the information. Therefore, a requester could argue that the public has a right to know about the agency's decision-making process regarding the disposal of potentially hazardous materials."
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Summary; ;     • We would agree to delay the EPA rule until  all of the issues  have  been  discussed with environmentalists and other stakeholders, including a process to  examine scientific issues related to the rule. We anticipate  that  this  process  will  take  six to ten months.	"The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be a communication between individuals within an agency discussing the potential delay of a rule and the process for examining scientific issues related to the rule. This type of communication would likely be considered deliberative and pre-decisional, and therefore exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 protects ""documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.""

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Summary; ;     • We would require, as a condition of these  commitments,  that  key  environmental groups agree to not challenge permits to dispose of category I and 2 material  at  the MDS (using the existing testing rule) until the end of I997.	"The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. Specifically, it could be argued that the statement falls under the deliberative process privilege, which protects communications that are part of the decision-making process and are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature.; ; In this case, the statement appears to be discussing negotiations and commitments related to environmental permits, which would likely be considered part of the agency's decision-making process. Additionally, the statement includes a condition that certain groups agree not to challenge permits, which could be seen as a deliberative effort to secure support for the agency's position.; ; One case that supports this interpretation is Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy (1981), in which the Supreme Court held that the deliberative process privilege protects communications that are ""predecisional and deliberative in nature, and that contain opinions, recommendations, or advice about agency policies."" Another relevant case is Public Citizen v. Office of Management and Budget (D.C. Cir. 1996), in which the court held that the privilege applies to communications that are ""part of the agency's deliberative process leading up to a decision.""; ; Overall, while there may be some debate over whether this statement is protected under exemption 5, it seems likely that it would be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under FOIA."
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Summary; ; Pros: This proposal is very close to that outlined by Pallone and Torricelli,  except  that we would use an appropriate administrative process  to  decide  on  closure  of  the  MDS  rather than announcing closure by fiat, and we  would  reject  the strict  volume  limitation  they propose in the interim. We would expect  that this will  disarm  environmental  criticism  and help move short-term dredging, but we would  want  to  elicit  an  understanding  with  New York and New Jersey that they will not be criticize short-term use of the MDS.	It is possible that this document could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language in the document suggests that it is discussing a proposal and potential negotiations with New York and New Jersey, which could be considered part of the agency's decision-making process. However, without more context it is difficult to determine whether any specific privilege would apply.; ; One potential argument for exemption 5 protection could be based on the deliberative process privilege, which shields communications that are part of the agency's decision-making process and reflect the agency's internal deliberations, opinions, and recommendations. The language in the document suggests that the agency is considering different options and weighing potential criticisms, which could be seen as part of the deliberative process. However, the agency would need to show that disclosure of the document would harm the agency's decision-making process in some way.; ; There is no specific case law cited in this response, as the analysis would depend on the specific facts and context of the document in question.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Summary; ; Cons: It will be difficult to convince  Representative  Menendez  that  this  approach  makes sense. Our position will be that  this  approach  will  accomplish  what  he  needs  by  ensuring that dredging can go on for the next year, while allowing  continued  use of the  MDS  for the very short term: In addition it will allow the EPA rule issues to  be  resolved  in  a  less contentious climate, after  further  work  with  affected  interests,  thereby  reducing  the likelihood  of  litigation  over  the rule itself.    We will need to work  closely  with  Menendez and his staff to help them understand the merits of delaying the rule, and enlist their help in persuading the unions and port companies that this  is the right course.  We  propose  to have those discussions in	person, rather than over email or other written communication, to avoid creating a paper trail that could be subject to FOIA requests.; ; This communication would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The proposed in-person discussions suggest an intent to keep the communication confidential, and the content of the communication involves strategy and advice related to a policy decision, which is typically considered privileged. ; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that the deliberative process privilege under exemption 5 protects communications that are part of the decision-making process and contain advice, opinions, and recommendations. The Court also noted that the privilege applies to communications that are predecisional and deliberative, meaning they were made before a final decision was reached and were intended to help shape that decision. ; ; In this case, the communication appears to be predecisional and deliberative, as it discusses a proposed approach to a policy decision and seeks to persuade a key stakeholder to support that approach. The fact that the communication suggests avoiding written communication to avoid creating a paper trail further supports the argument that it was intended to be confidential and privileged.
