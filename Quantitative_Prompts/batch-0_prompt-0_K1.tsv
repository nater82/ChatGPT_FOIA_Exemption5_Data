D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; HHS may want to raise the bucket as part of the technicals discussion Ron wants to have. Here's the story: for many months, HHS could only see their way clear to a partial fix of the bucket. Just as we were about to give up on this, Clay Shaw wrote a letter saying congressional intent was a 100% fix of the bucket. This caused HHS to go back to the drawing board (for months). They now see a way to do a 100% fix, but their legal theory conflicts with OMB counsel's theory, and for the moment it's stuck there.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The legal theory conflicts between HHS and OMB counsel could potentially fall under attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances and the agency's justification for withholding the information.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; So HHS wants to throw into the technical mix the possibility that Congress could clarify this issue, and they may raise it at our conference call tomorrow. OMB doesn’t disagree. | don't see any downside, other than if we have to use a chit for it. But Haskins is on our side here, so it may not use a chit.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications related to decision-making processes. It appears to be a discussion about potential actions and opinions of individuals outside of the agency.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; This morning | said we'd no longer need the bucket if the budget agreement becomes law. Not exactly so. Even with the budget agreement, some legal immigrants -- the elderly non-disabled -- who were in the U.S. before the welfare law was enacted will not get Medicaid coverage. States who wish to cover them without vastly expanding their Medicaid programs could do so if the bucket were enacted.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Ken is saying we can't do the bucket by 4/1, because CBO is reestimating the baseline in early/mid April and we don’t want it out before then. We are pressing him on his logic, since the cost of the bucket is already in the budget as a legislative proposal.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication. If it involves internal deliberations or legal advice, it may be protected. If it is simply a strategic decision or preference, it may not be protected. Ultimately, it would be up to the agency to determine whether the information should be withheld under exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Can we do by April 1?	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any privileged communication or deliberative process of a government agency.
D0//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; This e-mail 1) notifies you that the Health Division communicated your guidance to HCFA on the three Medicaid “welfare reform"" issues and 2) outlines HCFA's response to your guidance."	It is possible that this email could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications such as those between government agencies and their attorneys. However, it would depend on the specific circumstances and the nature of the guidance and response being discussed.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 1) SSI One-Month Gap -- We communicated to HCFA that the one-month gap policy should be made administratively through an All States Letter to the Medicaid Directors as well. HCFA will send over the All States Letter for OMB clearance later this week.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances and context of the communication.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 2) Medically-Needy -- We communicated to HCFA that the medically needy policy should be made administratively through an All States Letter to the Medicaid Directors as opposed to promulgating a regulation. HCFA said that they would discuss this option with their Office of General Counsel and notify us if they had any legal concerns. If not, HCFA will send over the All States Letter for OMB clearance. HCFA mentioned that they would like to distribute one All States Letter that would include both the medically needy policy and the delay regulation.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of discussions with HCFA's Office of General Counsel suggests that legal advice may have been sought or provided, which could qualify for exemption 5 protection. However, the ultimate determination of whether this information is exempt would depend on the specific circumstances and legal analysis of the case.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 3) Delay Regulation -- We communicated to HCFA that you approved of announcing HCFA's intention to promulgate this regulation, since the NPRM process could delay the impact of qualified aliens losing SSI. HCFA wants to send out on All States Letter to the Medicaid Directors announcing this policy and to advise that States could retain Medicaid coverage for SSI recipients in the meantime.	It is possible that this communication could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, more information would be needed to make a definitive determination, such as the specific nature of the communication and the type of privilege being claimed.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; First, we will schedule a meeting early next week with HCFA, OIRA, and the Health Division to discuss this regulation. Second, HCFA will send over the All States Letter for OMB clearance. This letter will include both the medically needy policy and the announcement of HCFA's intention to promulgate the delay regulation.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances and the nature of the communication.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We also noted to HCFA that these policies should be handled administratively with little publicity. HCFA agreed. To ensure a consolidated process, OMB policy officials need to coordinate with other EXOP officials in order to convey that these policies should be handled with minimal publicity.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the policies being discussed. If the policies are related to sensitive or confidential information, such as national security or personal privacy, then the statement may be protected. If the policies are routine or non-sensitive, then the statement may not be protected. Ultimately, it would be up to the agency to determine whether the statement qualifies for exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Latest status: We, especially OMB, are considering whether to do HHS's administrative fix to the bucket. It is not the advocates’ full fix, but a 2-part regulatory fix HHS devised: a temporary delay for everyone, which will help all states with a bucket problem; and a new policy on how states define “medically needy” Medicaid programs, which will permanently help some states with a bucket problem. Between the 2 parts, it will fix a decent portion of the bucket, but not all. (I will try to get a sense of how much.)	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication. If it involves internal deliberations or discussions related to policy decisions, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Nancy-Ann's first take is that Raines needs to decide whether HCFA must come up with an offset to the $1.9 billion cost. Ken and | have pointed out that we fixed a lot of the bucket in our welfare legistative fix package, in our proposal to exempt the disabled from SSI/Medicaid cuts. So theoretically we have already paid for a lot of this, and we're just transferring it from a legislative fix to an administrative fix. OMB is trying to scope out the overlap and numbers as they write a memo to Raines.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it pertains to internal deliberations and communications within the agency.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; lam assuming we would agree with HHS's approach. | think we exhausted the advocates’ approach. And it will do good things for people and it's fully or largely paid for. | should note that it could take a bit of the steam out of our legal immigrant fix package, since the most compelling cases of legal immigrants in nursing homes would then be temporarily addressed. 1 think the only exception to that would be in states that affirmatively decide not to extend Medicaid to legals, and i'm not sure there are any such states at this time.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to predecisional or deliberative information.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Option of total administrative fix off the table, unless COLO)sees something new.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided does not fall under any of these categories.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; - Budget's welfare legislative fix package includes partial fix for the bucket: exempt disabled legal immigrants from SSI cuts. This leaves out the elderly.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.
D1//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; - HHS's best admin fix thinking had 2 parts: -across the board 1 year delay; and -""medically needy” reg that will help some states."	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain privileged or confidential information related to agency decision-making or deliberations.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Neither of these last 2 are in the budget so, if we want to go ahead with them, we can't talk about them Till the budget's beén out for a while. But we could theoretically tell the groups whe the budge is released that we continue to ponder the question of admin fixes.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication. If it involves internal deliberations or legal advice, it may be exempt from disclosure. If it is simply a discussion of budgetary considerations, it may not be exempt. Ultimately, it would be up to a court to determine whether this statement is exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The OMB director has apparently at last opined on the “bucket” issue -- i.e., whether there is an administrative way to allow more people losing SSI to keep Medicaid.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific circumstances of the communication and whether it meets the criteria for exemption 5.
D1//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Raines endorsed HHS's partial fix, which we've also been pushing. (HHS rejected on legal grounds the advocates’ argument that we could do a total fix, where no one would lose Medicaid as a result of losing SSI.) This partial fix would create a temporary ""bucket"" for everyone losing SSI (for a year, | think). And it would beef up what is included in a “medically needy” program in a way that would help a group of states."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication. If it involves legal advice or deliberative processes, it may be exempt. Ultimately, it would be up to the agency to determine whether or not to release the information in response to a FOIA request.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The effect of this will be to convert part of our fix package from legislative to administrative. It also means health providers will be less interested in our package.	No, this statement does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies. This statement does not appear to contain privileged legal advice, attorney work product, or deliberative process information.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; OMB doesn't think we should announce anything in the next week or two, because CBO is doing some baseline reestimate.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The statement appears to be a communication between two agencies (OMB and CBO) and contains advice or recommendations regarding a decision-making process.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; While we have never been certain that this confusing issue could be packaged into some kind of | announcement or event, OMB would apparently oppose making a big deal about this publicly. They are nervous that we'll be criticized. Not sure this makes sense.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; This shou ROT pe announced or alluded to in our legal immigration briefing tomorrow.	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer as to whether the statement would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 without additional context. However, exemption 5 generally covers privileged communications within or between government agencies, including attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and deliberative process privilege.
T0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; There will be a staff level discussion within a few days on whether we should have an Administration bill on Superfund. Superfund reauthorization remains a priority for the majority in the Congress, and we will need to decide the Administration strategy soon. CEQ is contemplating calling a principal's meeting early next week.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the staff level discussion and the Administration strategy being considered. If the discussion involves legal advice or deliberative processes related to policy decisions, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; This note is to ask your engagement on the process and to quickly summarize the options for strategy and my recommendation.	As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to determine whether the given statement would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. However, FOIA exemption 5 generally covers privileged communications, such as attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and certain deliberative process materials. Whether the given statement falls under any of these categories would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the communication.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; With regard to the process, | believe that any principal's meeting on this should be jointly convened mol by CEQ and NEC. @ economic issues are some of the driving issues here. A jointly convened : Séting W sénd an important message of balance on this issue. | plan to make this argument at the staff level. | suggest that you mention this to Gene Sperling.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of government decision-making.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The strategy options are three:	"No, the statement ""The strategy options are three"" does not contain any information that would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process privilege."
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A) Prepare Administration principles, but allow agency assistance to both majority and minority staff to improve/prepare their bills. (There is a republican bill, there is as yet no dem alternative.) [It would need to be absolutely clear that assistance does not guarantee Administration endorsement. EPA is likely to support this view.	It is possible that this could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific nature of the communications and whether they meet the criteria for exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; B) Prepare a narrow Administration bill. This approach would send three key signals: (1) we are serious about reform, (2) all Departments will have a voice, and (3) we will only support moderate changes. CEQ is leaning slightly towards this view.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; C) Prepare a broad Administration bill. This approach would likely provide the most comfort to DOE and DOD because they will see this as a potentially disciplining process for the other Agencies. DOJ (Lois Schiffer) would vehemently oppose this approach.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication. If it was part of a deliberative process or involved legal advice, it may be considered privileged. Ultimately, it would be up to the agency to determine if the exemption applies and if the information should be withheld.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; | recommend that we initially support option A. In my view, the key supporting reasons are: 1) An Administration process to come up with a bill will be extremely contentious and will distract from our effectiveness on the Hill. 2) If we genuinely want a bill we will need to negotiate with the majority and there is no particular advantage to having spent months coming up with our own bill fist. 3) Principles that set a high standard, will provide guidance to negotiations and will provide thetorical cover to strengthen our hand in the negotiations.	It is possible that this could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the communication.

Ultimately, it would be up to the agency to determine whether or not to release the information in response to a FOIA request.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The key weaknesses in this approach are: 1) Some departments will be unhappy enough to undertake their own discreet Hill efforts. | discount this concern because no matter what we do, departments will let their views be known to the Hill.

My response would be that our leadership is in Brownfields and in the Administrative reforms.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the communication. If it was part of a deliberative process aimed at developing policy or making decisions, it may be considered privileged.

This statement does not fall under any of the categories protected by exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; As the President said in his State of the Union address, we can be proud that after decades of finger-pointing and failure, we are now replacing welfare checks with paychecks. Welfare caseloads have fallen another 2.4 million in the first 13 months of the new welfare reform law, a decline of 4.3 million, or 30 percent, since President Clinton took office. The President’s 1999 budget will build on this success, providing several targeted new tools to help even more people move from welfare to work, while restoring certain food stamp cuts which had nothing to do with welfare reform.

D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Welfare to Work Housing Vouchers. The President's FY99 budget will take further steps to promote work and welfare reform through a new $283 million plan to provide 50,000 new housing vouchers to welfare recipients who need housing assistance in order to get or keep ajob. Families could use these housing vouchers to move closer to a new job, to reduce a long commute, or to secure more stable housing to eliminate emergencies that keep them from getting to work every day on time. These vouchers, awarded to communities on a competitive basis, will give people on welfare a new tool to make the transition to a job and succeed in the work place. ‘	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Welfare to Work Transportation. One of the biggest barriers facing people who move from welfare to work -- in cities and in rural areas -- is finding transportation to get to jobs, training programs, and child care centers. Few welfare recipients own cars. Existing mass transit does not provide adequate links to many suburban jobs at all, or within a reasonable commute time. In addition, many entry level jobs require evening or weekend hours that are poorly served by existing transit routes. To help welfare recipients and other low income workers get to where the jobs are, President Clinton has proposed a $100 million a year welfare to work transportation plan as part of his ISTEA reauthorization bill. This competitive grant program would assist states and localities in developing flexible transportation alternatives, such as van services.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Tax Credits for Employers. The President’s budget proposal extends two important tax credits for employers for an additional year. The Welfare to Work Tax Credit, enacted in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, provides a credit equal to 35 percent of the first $10,000 in wages in the first year of employment, and 50 percent of the first $10,000 in wages in the second year, to encourage the hiring and retention of long term welfare recipients. The budget also extends the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which provides a credit of up to $2,400 for the first year of wages for eight groups of job seekers.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications, deliberations, or documents.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Food Stamps for Legal Immigrants: The President believes that legal immigrants should have the same opportunity, and bear the same responsibility, as other members of society. To that end, the President’s 1999 budget proposes to restore Food Stamp benefits for vulnerable groups of legal immigrants. The President’s proposals would provide Food Stamp benefits to 730,000 legal immigrants in 1999 at,a cost of $2.5 billion over 5 years. Specifically, benefits would be restored for: all families with ‘children; immigrants with disabilities and elderly immigrants age 65 and older who entered the U.S. before welfare reform was enacted, on the same basis as the SSI and Medicaid restorations in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act; refugees and asylees, whose eligibility would be extended from 5 to 7 years; Hmong immigrants who came to the U.S. after the Vietnam war; and certain Native Americans living along the Canadian and Mexican borders.

However, exemption 5 generally applies to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided appears to be a policy proposal rather than a privileged communication, so it may not be protected under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Ways and Means: Restores benefits for current beneficiaries, including the elderly, but not for new applicants (those who were in the country prior to 8/22/96 and became disabled after that date)	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

The President could visit a business where the President and Prime Minister could talk with an employer, former welfare recipients, and the public officials involved in welfare reform in that community.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve any communication between government agencies or officials that would qualify as privileged or confidential.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Giant Foods, Inc. has an excellent program in Prince George’s County, MD that would be ideal for this visit.

D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; To date, Giant has hired 71 of 91 people interviewed (exceeding the normal hire rate of 1 in 4). In the four months since the program began, only 5 people have left (compared to Giant's typical attrition rate of 50%). As soon as people enter Giant's training, they earn $6.60-$8.75 per hour (depending on the position) and receive full medical benefits within 30 days.

The company is partially owned by a British firm, J. Sainsbury PLC, the leading food retailer in the UK. Their training program is a partnership between Giant, the Private Industry Council, and the local welfare office in Prince George's County. We understand that the UFCW union supports the program, but will get more details. Governor Glendening's office is excited about the program and about the potential visit.	No, this information does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies. This information pertains to a private company, a partnership with non-governmental entities, and statements from a government official and a union, none of which would fall under exemption 5.

D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; I think we would want to show the Prime Minister how we are reforming welfare in America, i.e., how the public and private sectors are working together to move welfare recipients, who _are_ here primarily single women, to work. | do not think we would want to focus a visit on young men just because that’s what they're considering in Britain, but we would rather want to focus on the how-to-connect-welfare-recipients-to-jobs issue that seems to also be a strong interest of theirs.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications such as those between government officials and their advisors. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the statement.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Just had a lengthy and enlightening conversation with Cecilia Calvo at W2W Partnership. She is a weaith of information about what's going on in U.K. re: welfare reform, having recently led a group of high level British officials on a tour to NY, Washington, St Louis and Milwaukee and spending several weeks in Britain learning about what they are doing. She says that the most immediate focus is a 'New Deal’ for 18-24 year olds, starting in 12 pilot sites in January and going national in April. The program targets unemployed youth who will be called in once they have received assistance for 6 months. They will come into a job center, meet with a 'New Deal' advisor, get andassessment, and if determined job ready, go to work. If not, they will go through 12 weeks officialsStrive-like job readiness, including assessment for substance abuse and learning disabilities, then goingto one of four steps: unsubsidized job, long-term training, voluntary sector sort of like workingexperience), or work in the environmental! sector.

Cecilia is sending me some info about some Americorps/welfare reform partnerships in Florida and NY. She said her visit to YouthBuild in St Louis was also good. At the same time, she says Blair et al remain very interested in how to operate effective job centers and private sector involvement. Se®Ms to me the quéStion is to what extent we want to highlight the youth issue, since the population the Brits are targeting is not really a primary focus of our welfare reform initiatives. Do you have any thoughts on this?	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

As an AI language model, I do not have the necessary context to determine whether the information provided would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and attorney work product.

We'd be happy to discuss these sites with you to help narrow it down.	As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to determine whether the document would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. However, exemption 5 generally applies to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. It is possible that some portions of the document may be exempt under this exemption, but it would depend on the specific content and context of the information.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Background on where things stand in U.K. (based on press clips and recent visits of British officials) Frank Field, the social security minister, has submitted a ‘green paper’ on welfare reform to the PM Blair for review. Apparently this takes a comprehensive, though general, look at reforming a wide range of benefit programs including pensions and disability benefits. Benefits to the disabled are a large and rapidly growing component of welfare spending. Proposals have been floated to cut benefits to the disabled, generating intense ‘opposition from many in the Labour party.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.
D0//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; On December 10th, Parliament approved a cut in benefits for lone (single) parents. This was supported by Blair, Social Security secretary Harriet Harman, and Chancellor Gordon Brown. Apparently this was necessary to meet the budget targets set by the Tory Government. The proposal created a major revolt by Labour backbenchers, leading to several resignations, and 47 Labour MPs voting against the proposal. Blair and Brown justified their position as one of the ‘hard choices’ that Labour must make, demonstrating a commitment to live within tough spending limits and consistent with weaning single parents from welfare to work. As part of the package, Brown announced a new child care program and a “New Deal"" jobs program to help people move into work. The cuts, and the new programs, are scheduled for implementation in April."	It is possible that some portions of this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the government. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communications involved. For example, if there were internal government discussions or memos about the decision to cut benefits for lone parents, those could potentially be exempt from disclosure. However, if the information is already publicly available (such as statements made by Blair, Harman, and Brown), it would not be exempt.
D0//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Concern about promoting responsibility, reducing dependency, and addressing underclass.

This group will focus on: tackling the problems of school expulsion and chronic truancy, reducing the number of people sleeping on the streets, and improving the qualify of life on the worst ‘housing estates’ (presumably, and ironically, this translates to housing projects in U.S. English)."	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.

Small businesses notify the Job Connection (via a 1-800 number) when they have a vacancy. The Job Connection geocodes the job location, and provides geocoded information about nearby supportive services, i.e. child care and transportation.

The state is about to award $5 million in ‘barrier busting’ grants to localities, with about 85% of the grants focusing on transportation. Particularly in rural and suburban areas, mass transit is not sufficient to address the needs of welfare recipients going to work.

D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; @ Lone (single) parents are a secondary focus. Currently they are able to collect benefits until their youngest child is 16. They are now being invited in on a voluntary basis to participate in employment and training assistance. It remains to be seen whether this will occur on a large scale--funding is not adequate to make it mandatory.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The following are potential policy announcements you could make at the upcoming Summit on service and in the radio address on Saturday.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; RADIO ADDRESS You will announce that we are sending our America Reads legislation to the Hill, and use that opportunity to emphasize AmeriCorps’ role in America Reads. You can also talk about your vision of the Summit and highlight America Reads as a great example of meeting the Summit’s challenge on volunteering, tutoring, and literacy. In addition, you can announce that Federal agencies are making a “commitment” to the Summit that they will expand the number of schools that they have adopted or established partnerships with from approximately 1,500 schools to 2,000 schools by the year 2000. Working through partnerships established by their agencies, Federal employees tutor, purchase equipment, and hold career days.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege, deliberative process privilege, and certain types of work product privilege. The language in the passage suggests that it may be part of a strategy or plan being developed by the agency, which could fall under the deliberative process privilege. However, without more context it is difficult to say for certain whether this information would be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; MONDAY SPEECH AT SUMMIT When you laid out your original vision of national service back in 1992, you set forth two fundamental principles that captured the public imagination: first, that all young Americans willing to give something back should have the chance to get help for college; and second, that we should challenge those young people to help solve our toughest problems, “as teachers, police officers, child care workers -- doing work our country desperately needs,” as you said in the first Georgetown speech.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; AmeriCorps, though still a well-kept secret, has gone a long way toward realizing your overall ideal of citizen service. But for budgetary and partisan political reasons, it will not become universal anytime soon, and because of its decentralized structure, AmeriCorps has not succeeded in marshaling a nation-wide effort to target a compelling national problem like education or crime.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications. FOIA exemption 5 only applies to documents that are part of the decision-making process within an agency.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Your speech in Philadelphia is a chance to breathe new life into that original ideal. We can’t escape the budgetary constraints, but we can give more young people an incentive to serve, and most important, we can set forth a clear national mission of the problems we need them to solve.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications, attorney-client privilege, or deliberative process privilege.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The following proposal are designed with that in mind. 1. Interest-free Year of Service As you know, Rev. Tony Campolo has urged you to make it easier for college students and recent graduates to take a year off for service. Thanks to your income-contingent loan program and to earlier changes allowing loan deferments for service, students can already take advantage of reduced loan payments if they take low-paying service jobs, and can take time off for service without having to begin repayment of their loans. Your FY98 budget also includes a proposal to encourage service by no longer treating loan forgiveness as taxable income, so that students who universities forgive their loans will no longer have to pay taxes on it.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the proposal and its development.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The only remaining barrier is the interest that accumulates on unsubsidized loans during the period of service. The cost of having the Federal government pay that interest is minimal -- $7 million over 5 years. This is an inexpensive proposal, and the typical benefit is not enormous, but it would make this policy universal, and it would allow any young person to take time off to serve without increasing his or her debt burden. The Education Department has expressed some concerns about this.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The Education Department's concerns may fall under the deliberative process privilege, which protects pre-decisional communications that are part of the agency's decision-making process. However, whether or not this information is actually protected would depend on the specific circumstances and context of the communication.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 2. Police Corps  You can announce $20 million in grants to 17 states for the Police Corps program. The Police Corps was created in your 1994 Crime Bill to increase the number of community police officers with advanced education and training, and was one of your pledges during the 1992 presidential campaign. :	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in this example does not fall under this category and would likely be releasable under FOIA.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The Police Corps offers educational assistance to qualified college students who commit to enter the police after graduation and serve in the force for at least four years. Students accepted into the Police Corps receive up to $7,500 in educational assistance for up to four years of undergraduate study. In addition, Corps recruits receive 16 weeks of rigorous training to help make them effective community police officers. As an incentive to police departments to take recruits, state and local law enforcement agencies receive cash assistance for employing Police Corps officers -- $10,000 per participant for each year of the recruit’s service.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; This announcement nearly triples the number of states that will receive Police Corps funds, from 6 to 17 states, and is double the funding appropriated in FY 1996 for the program. It will fund about 650 recruits. Your FY 1998 budget contains $20 million in funding for Police Corps.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications, deliberations, or documents.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 3. Teacher Corps We believe your Summit speech should include a ringing call to service for young people to teach in inner cities. Nothing would do more to breathe new life into the ethic of service than to enlist young Americans in a national effort to transform inner-city schools that are crying out for their energy, idealism, and talent.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; One way to do this would be to announce the proposal described below, which provides $400 million over four years in incentives for approximately 48,000 new teachers. If this seems too costly to propose in the current budget environment, it could be ramped up more slowly at about half the cost and impact. You could also propose a more modest expansion of AmeriCorps’ support for Teach for America, as long as we also address quality concerns about that program. Alternatively, your speech could simply include a strong call to young people to take up the challenge of teaching in inner cities without proposing a new initiative to provide federal support. Such an initiative could still be included in the Administration’s Higher Education Act proposal, which will be transmitted this summer.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the communication. If the proposal was still in the early stages of development and had not yet been officially announced or implemented, it may be considered pre-decisional and deliberative, and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, if the proposal had already been publicly announced or implemented, it may not be protected under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Over the next decade, the nation will need to hire some 2.3 million teachers. Of these, approximately 15%, or 345,000 (approximately 35,000 per year), will be hired in central cities, in schools with large concentrations of low income students. An additional 207,000 (approximately 20,000 per year) will be needed in isolated, and often poor, rural areas. These types of communities face the greatest difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified teachers. Urban areas in particular receive significantly fewer applications for positions than neighboring suburban districts, and attrition rates in urban areas can often reach 30% to 50% in the first five years. They are therefore most likely to fill classroom vacancies with teachers who lack preparation, don’t meet licensure requirements, or who are teaching outside their field. As a result, the students in these communities -- who need the most qualified teachers in order to meet higher academic standards -- often get exactly the opposite in the classroom.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We propose a new national effort to help attract and retain teachers in high poverty central city and rural schools. This new initiative would be a part of the Administration’s proposal for the reauthorization of Title V of the Higher Education Act. The basic framework for this initiative could be announced at the summit, while many of the details could be further  developed by the Education Department over the coming months.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain privileged or confidential information related to agency decision-making or deliberations.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; This initiative would provide competitive grants to 100 local partnerships involving urban or rural school districts and institutions of higher education, to be used to provide incentives for individuals to prepare to teach, and to remain, in underserved schools. These would include 2-3 year fellowships for undergraduate students (including for a “Sth year” program that provides intensive and sustained classroom experience for undergraduates after they have acquired a strong liberal arts background); one-year graduate fellowships for post-baccalaureate students, including recent liberal arts graduate and mid-career professionals seeking to enter teaching; stipends for teachers’ aides and other education.paraprofessionals seeking to move up a career ladder into full teaching positions; and 1-2 year “residencies” for beginning teachers that would provide a lighter teaching load coupled with additional time for class preparation, being coached or mentored, or working in other ways with more experienced teachers.	It is possible that some parts of this initiative could be protected under FOIA exemption 5 if they involve pre-decisional or deliberative material, such as internal discussions or recommendations. However, other parts of the initiative, such as the specific details of the grants and fellowships, may not be protected under exemption 5 and could be subject to disclosure under FOIA. Ultimately, the determination of whether or not this initiative is protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific content and context of the records in question.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The incentives would range from fellowships that cover tuition and fees (which average $3,500 at undergraduate public institutions) to forgivable loans to salary supplements for beginning teachers. Successful competitors would have to demonstrate that they have a high quality teacher preparation program, and that the program fits into a comprehensive, thoughtful strategy for recruiting and retaining teachers.	No, this statement does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 typically applies to privileged communications, such as those between government officials and their advisors, or those that would reveal the government's decision-making process. This statement appears to be a description of a proposed program and does not contain any privileged information.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The Education Department proposes to fund this initiative at $100 million a year for five years, beginning with the FY1999 budget. The Education Department estimates that this initiative will help attract and retain at least 48,000 teachers into high poverty central city and rural schools. This is approximately 17% of the estimated need in those communities. This is not an issue for this year’s appropriations battles, and we have not tried to identify a specific offset. However, it will compete with your other discretionary priorities in the out-years. If you wish to proceed, we will work with OMB to determine what funding level we can commit to right now, recognizing that the parameters of NDD spending may change before we submit the FY99 budget.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language about competing with other discretionary priorities in the out-years suggests that this is a sensitive internal discussion about budget priorities, which could be considered privileged. However, it would ultimately be up to a court to determine whether this exemption applies in a specific case.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We are also exploring ways to link this initiative to AmeriCorps, which already provides scholarships (but no stipends) to 1,000 teachers in Teach for America. As you know, Teach for . America has been fairly successful in capturing the imagination of the public and of college students, but to this point has not provided the preparation and support those new teachers need to succeed in the classroom and remain in the profession. We could use existing scholarship funds to expand AmeriCorps’ commitment to Teach for America, but we should also look for ways to make sure that preparation needs are addressed.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the communication. If it was part of a deliberative process or involved attorney-client privilege, it may be exempt. Ultimately, it would be up to the agency to determine if the information falls under exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 4. Child Care Corps You could also announce that you will expand AmeriCorps to include a new child care corps. The child care field has great difficulty attracting and retaining qualified workers, especially well-educated and trained workers who can go on to become leaders in the field. Your recent conference on early learning was the latest confirmation that it is critical to increase the quality of child care. Yet very few of our most talented young people enter this field.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The program would offer AmeriCorps scholarships to individuals who agree to work in child care in low-income areas for two years. It would be open both to those currently working in the field and to those seeking to enter. Members of the corps would not get a stipend from AmeriCorps, but a scholarship of $4,725 a year for two years, which could be used either to repay existing student loans or to pay for further education. Some of these scholarships could be earmarked to help people leaving welfare to get college training to become child care workers.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example does not fall under this category.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The Corporation for National Service estimates that it could support a corps of 2,000 people a year without any increase in their budget or permission from Congress, as long as these individuals get only scholarships and not stipends as well. Under pressure from members of Congress to reduce the cost of an AmeriCorps member, the Corporation has begun to emphasize these “scholarship only” awards, and its scholarship trust fund has excess funds.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege, deliberative process privilege, and certain types of work product privilege. The Corporation for National Service may argue that this information is part of their internal deliberations and decision-making processes regarding the allocation of resources and funding for AmeriCorps members, and therefore falls under the deliberative process privilege. However, it ultimately depends on the specific circumstances and context of the information in question, and whether the Corporation can demonstrate that disclosure would harm their ability to make informed decisions or carry out their mission.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Non-profit groups would apply to become part of this program, and would have to demonstrate that they could offer participants high-quality training and mentoring during their two years of service, including development of management and leadership skills. In addition, corporations could sponsor members by paying for their salaries, and universities that specialize in early childhood education could match our scholarships.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 5. Mentoring/Tutoring 1 Million Kids In preparation for the Summit, Federal agencies have joined their counterparts in the private and non-profit sectors by making public “commitments” to the goals of the Summit. Agencies have identified over 40 initiatives where they will work with partners in the volunteer or service sectors to mentor and tutor kids, expand afterschool programs, and offer young people opportunities to serve. We are trying to determine whether these commitments add up to an additional 1 million kids being mentored or tutored as a result of Federal government efforts.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; FIRST LADY SPEECH AT CLOSING CEREMONY The First Lady will represent the Administration at the closing ceremony on Tuesday. We are exploring the option that she could announce Kaiser Permanente’s commitment of $100 million over the next five years to provide health coverage to 50,000 children in California.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications or deliberations.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Police youth academies are active in many Communities across the country.' The structure and participants vary greatly from program to program, but each one is structured around creating constructive interactions between police and young people. Most of the existing  Programs are co-sponsored by law enforcement agencies and schools or community groups, including Kiwanis, YMCA, scouting organizations, and business groups.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example does not fall under this category.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Components of Police Youth Academies Current academies contain some or all of the following program elements:  - basic orientation to law enforcement (arrest procedures, search procedures, ethics) ~ physical fitness and sports; - orientation to law enforcement as a career (challenges, responsibilities); - conflict resolution and dealing with peer pressure; - role-playing exercises for police-youth interactions; - field trips to jails, courts, training facilities, etc.; - antigang and drug programs; - building self-esteem and attitude management; - tutoring.	It is possible that some of the information related to the specific program elements of Police Youth Academies could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications and deliberative process. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances of the information being requested. For example, if the information pertains to internal discussions or decision-making processes related to the development or implementation of the program, it may be protected. On the other hand, if the information is purely factual or historical in nature, it may not be protected. Ultimately, the determination of whether information is exempt under FOIA exemption 5 would need to be made on a case-by-case basis.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Structure and Participants The range for participant ages varies from elementary school students (Delray, FL Kids and COPS Academy and Dekalb County, GA Junior Police Academy) to high school-level and older (NYPD Youth Academy, Howard County, MD Youth Police Academy). Some programs are structured as periodic after-school or evening programs (Dayton, OH Youth Police Academy) or month-long summer programs (Enfield, CT), while others are more intensive, Los Angeles has considered a full-time magnet-like high school program modeled on a youth police academy.	No, this information does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies. This information is about the structure and participants of youth police academy programs and does not involve privileged communications.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Some programs allow any interested young person to apply. Some programs are adjuncts to other programs (such as the Boy Scouts’ Police Explorer program), and thus participants are drawn from that pool. Others base participation on referrals from teachers, school officials or the police themselves in light of disciplinary matters or minor skirmishes with police.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example does not fall under this category.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The Athol, MA Youth Police Academy confers academic “extra credit” on its participants.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The academic credit offered by the Athol, MA Youth Police Academy is not related to any such communication.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; * Our survey of press reports turned up Police Youth Academies in Athol, MA; Enfield, CT; Orange County, CA; New York, NY; Hartford, CT; Portland, OR; Howard County, MD; Los Angeles, CA; Garland, TX; Kansas City, MO; Delray, FL; Dayton, OH; Dekalb County, GA.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the statement does not fall under this category.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Current Availability of Federal Funding There does not appear to be a realistic prospect of committing any FY 97 J ustice resources to directly support police youth academies. Although the Bureau of Justice Assistance was appropriated a relatively small amount of truly discretionary funding, BJA already has issued program plans and solicitations that account for all of the available funding.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by the deliberative process privilege. The statement appears to be part of an internal agency discussion about the availability of funding and the decision not to allocate resources to support police youth academies. It reflects the agency's deliberations and decision-making process, which could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The COPS statute, as enacted, would permit the Department of Justice’s COPS Office to make discretionary grants to support police youth academies. See 42 U.S.C. § 3796dd d)(5), (7) (grants authorized to develop and implement “citizens’ police academy” and to “establish and implement innovative programs to increase and enhance proactive crime control and prevention programs involving law enforcement officers and young persons in the community”).

However, a determination would need to be made based on the specific circumstances and context of the information in question.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The Law Enforcement Scholarships and Recruitment Act, 42 U.S.C. § 14111 et seq, passed as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, authorizes funds to be provided to states to pay costs of part-time or summer employment for high school juniors and seniors which consists of “performing meaningful tasks that inform students of the nature of the tasks performed by law enforcement agencies.” Although none of the police youth academy programs that we have identified currently provides paid employment to its participants, one could design an academy-type program building on a job assignment of some sort. No funds have been appropriated to implement the Law Enforcement Scholarships and Recruitment Act to date. Moreover, the authorization of appropriations provision states that of funds appropriated for this Act, only 20% may be used to provide employment, while 80% must be used to provide scholarships for career law enforcement officers.	"No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" The information provided in the passage does not appear to be a memorandum or letter, nor does it appear to be subject to any other exemption under FOIA."
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Other Considerations While many of the police youth academies currently in operation appear to be popular and successful, it is our perception that a decision to make federal funding of police youth academies a priority would be greeted at best skeptically by police management and labor  organizations, and most likely with some degree of resentment or hostility 6; expeciations that already exist for the use of Crime Act funding, We currently are facine ene g. We currently are facing significant unmet demand for funding to support more “core” law enforcement o erations, such as for technology, continuation of expiring domestic violence iniiatives, and forthe law enforcement scholarshyy described above. In addition, the past and current appropriations for the Police Corps program, while the Law Enforcement Scholarship program remains unfunded, has engendered  dissatisfaction from many quarters in law enforcement that would be exacerbated by funding additional programs not benefiting police more directly.

Nobody here, including me,thinks the President will be satisfied with or well served by simply talking about options and appointing a task force to come up with a plan. This approach will fail to capitalize on the incredible media attention at the summit, and may not sufficiently focus attention on the importance of attracting well prepared people into teaching. Further, we can waste an awful lot of time just appointing and organizing a task force, time which could otherwise be spent fleshing out a legislative proposal and consulting informally and extensively.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; As | read this and talk to others, it seems to be there are a couple of components to what the President could do, without reaching premature closure.	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer without more context. However, exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) generally protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional, deliberative, and privileged. Whether the statement you provided would be protected under this exemption would depend on the specific circumstances and content of the communication.

Students enrolled in this program attend the traditional academic courses. All of their class instruction, however, is presented with a law enforcement emphasis. When discussing speed and distance in a math course, for instance, story problems and examples may be tied to a police report of an accident scene. Two police officers work fulltime at the school, assisting with curriculum development and instructing teachers about the police department and crime issues.	It is possible that some aspects of this program could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications and deliberative process. For example, any internal communications or documents related to the development of the curriculum or the involvement of police officers in the program could potentially be withheld under this exemption. However, it is also possible that other aspects of the program, such as general information about its goals and structure, would not be protected and could be released under FOIA. Ultimately, the determination of what information can be withheld under exemption 5 would depend on the specific content of the records in question and the agency's justification for withholding them.

D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Our 98 budget request for AmeriCorps is $422 million, with $100 million of that recommended to go into the trust fund. Congress gets involved in deciding the split. This funding is supposed to fund 35,000 members (ramp-up is AmericaReads).	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege, deliberative process privilege, and certain types of work product privilege. The specific context and circumstances of the communication would need to be evaluated to determine if it meets the criteria for exemption 5 protection.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We could madify the split of our budget request without increasing the total. This would be very popular with Grassley; unclear with other members. The question is where to stop. At an extreme, OMB and | did very rough numbers that if we immediately transferred everything into scholarship only, we could fund something like 85,000 more people next year (assuming 40% are part-timers, which I'm not sure of). If we did a major, sudden change, the world that is used to getting AmeriCorps people would have big problems scrambling for all that stipend money, and quite possibly some of the money would go unspent, which would be bad.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the communication. If it was part of a deliberative process or involved advice or recommendations from agency officials, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; One option is that the increase we are proposing in the size of AmeriCorps could be all scholarship-only, but that could create the expectation that our America Reads people would be the ones who lose out on the stipend. Or maybe you like that idea. ,	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; OMB suggested increasing the local match rate over time. Currently applicants pay 15% of the stipend. Increasing that to 25% or 30% would have the effect of freeing up scholarship only money, but it doesn't match the idea of challenging certain folks to come up with the whole stipend. So we need a better idea. ,	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement does not appear to fall under any of the categories of privileged or confidential information protected by exemption 5.

D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; On the cost per AmeriCorps member, here is some info: @ Average cost per AmeriCorps member for fiscal year 1996 -- $17,629. e Agreement with Grassley will reduce that to $17,000 for fiscal year 1997; $16,000 for fiscal year 1998; and $15,000 by fiscal year 1999.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to pre-decisional or deliberative processes of the government. It is simply factual information about the cost per AmeriCorps member.

D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; He wrote about deferral. The President responded in March {Mike Cohen wrote it) that deferments are in fact alréady available, and that the Department would send him some information on that. We then scoured the area for what more we could do, and came up with this. | am trying to reach Campolo in Hawaii to see what he thinks.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.

D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Which did Campolo have in mind? Deferral or forgiveness?	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any privileged communication or deliberative process of a government agency.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Bruce -- note well that (as | understand it) this proposal is not to defer, but to forgive the year's worth of interest.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement appears to be a communication between two individuals and does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; On student loans and service, here's the story. There are 4 types of breaks on student loans you can offer people who serve.	As an AI language model, I do not have personal beliefs or opinions. However, the statement provided does not appear to contain information that would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies. The statement appears to be a general statement about student loans and service, and does not contain any confidential or privileged information.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 1. Income contingency -- We did this in 1993. It says that if you can take a low-paying service job, your loan payments will be only a limited percentage of your income, and ultimately forgiven after 25 years.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications. It is a policy or program that is available to the public and therefore not exempt from disclosure.
D1//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 2. Loan deferment -- This predates us. It is used when (1) someone wants to take time off during school but doesn't want to have to start paying back loans during that time; or (2) someone finishes school, but argues they have a good reason they don't want to start paying back their loans. You can get a deferment for up to 3 years. You are eligible if you are unemployed, or if it would create an ""economic hardship,” which includes service. There is no separate service deferment. There used to be, but the system got so complex that it was simplified in 1992."	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any privileged communications within or between government agencies.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 3. Subsidize all loan deferments for service-- This is our new idea. This means that no interest accumulates on loans during the period of service. We already do this for subsidized loans, which are about 2/3 of the volume, so this would fix unsubsidized loans and make it universal.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The $7 million cost over five years would allow 12,000 borrowers with unsubsidized loans to get this benefit during their deferment. The average benefit would be $600. This estimate assume that no one is induced to serve. If the program cost doubled to $14 million because the subsidized deferment would be more attractive, the number of beneficiaries would increase to 24,000, each receiving $600.	No, this information does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies. This information appears to be factual and does not involve any privileged communications.
D1//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In answer to your question as to whether we could do this for more than one year of service: This cost estimate already assumes that this could be for up to 3 years. The estimate simply reflects historical data on people who request a deferment due to economic hardship for ""service-related"" reasons, so it is a mix of people requesting 1, 2, and 3 years of deferments. |.don't think we would want to go past the 3 year point."	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve predecisional or deliberative information, attorney-client privilege, or attorney work product. It is simply a statement of historical data and a decision on the maximum length of deferment.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 4. Tax Incentives for Student Loan Forgiveness - This is our existing legislative proposal. It says loan forgiveness for service reasons by non-profit charitable or educational institutions should not be taxable.

Thad an OPM draft circulating, in the hopes it would be ready in time for the summit. However, OMB just informed me that the Labor Dept. has raised a major policy objection to it, saying that it is bad timing with the alternative work schedule bill S4 we are fighti ublicans over on the Hill, and that it would give ammunition to those we are fighting. | haven't had much time to focus on the merits of this objection, figuring this was probably the death knell for this idea, but | can pursue if you want me to.	It is possible that this could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and whether the communication meets the criteria for exemption 5.

No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government agency. It is simply a request for a meeting to discuss options.

Bruce--To get this off to the right start, you need to call Mike Smith. | want him to think from the outset that this is not just another, early run on the higher ed. reauthorization proposal for the sake of an event. (At some point he will figure out that it is a specia/early run on the higher ed reauthorization proposal , but hopefully not till we are further downt he road). A call from you, rather than me, telling him that POTUS really wants to do something concrete at the summit, as part of a larger package on the service professions, and perhaps mentioning Riley's call to you about the Summit last night, will set this in the right context for Mike.	It is possible that this communication could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications such as those between government officials and their advisors. However, it would depend on the specific circumstances and context of the communication, as well as any applicable legal precedents.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 3. In addition to the kind of purpose and design issues we discussed last night -- reward vs. incentive, concentrated vs. spread out, etc. -- we need to figure out some budget parameters here. Does ED have room in current/projected budget? How were they going to pay for this part of their proposal anyway? If we go with a legislative initiative as part of higher ed act, which won't pass for at least a year and more likely the end of this session, then the $ won't start flowing until FY 99 or perhaps 2000. Is this a problem, or does it help?	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are protected by the deliberative process privilege.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Let me know if this makes sense to you, and if you call Mike. Or, you may see him in the cabinet mtg.

D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; According to Jen Palmieri, the President actually asked to meet with Harris to have a general discussion of some sort on service.	As an AI language model, I do not have the authority to determine whether the following statement would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. However, exemption 5 generally covers privileged communications within or between government agencies, including attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and deliberative process privilege. Whether the statement falls under any of these categories would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the communication.
D0//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; | forwarded you a memo Harris sent to the President last week in preparation for this meeting (the one that begins by quoting a 17th century poem, dated January 22). That memo goes beyond service to say that the President's special ""trinity"" of legacy issues are education, service, and race, and that the President should try to show the link between the three -- that they are all about ""one America."" He argues that focusing on the 5. summit goals for children is the way to do this, although | never find that argument totally convincing. Steve Silverman is collecting all the recent Harris missives for the President to review prior to the meeting."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch, including inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances and context of the memo and the meeting.
D1//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The links to race seem most promising -- a town hall taking off from the SOTU, with military, Peace pedple together to serve across racial lines. Also, Gomperts has been talking about proposing a “thinkers” conference on service -- to discuss how to bring service ""up to scale"", and to try to find  common ground with ""compassionate conservatives"" like Coates and Kasich who favor tax credits for charitable contributions to support the volunteer sector."	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of government agencies.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; | still think this is dopey, and we shouldn't waste a lot of time on it Monday. But it might be nice for the President to say something about it on Tuesday, when he has a big mentoring event at the WH. Can you find out if America's Promise expects any major press on this?	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This message appears to be an internal discussion about how to handle a potential public statement from the President, and therefore could be considered part of the decision-making process.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; What are the President and Harris meeting about on Friday?	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. However, it would depend on the specific circumstances and context of the meeting. If the discussion pertains to sensitive national security or diplomatic matters, for example, it may be exempt from disclosure. Ultimately, it would be up to the agency or court reviewing the FOIA request to determine if exemption 5 applies.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Attached is stuff cobbled together from Cabinet Affairs, me, and John Gomperts that will form the basis for the briefing memo on tomorrow's meeting that Cabinet Affairs is putting together.

However, it would ultimately depend on the specific content and context of the information.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We asked Gomperts what Harris might bring up. No big surprises (reauthorization, race), but 2 little ones: First, he may raise exempting AmeriCorps education awards from taxation. Today they are treated as income. It would cost about $14 million; it’s not in the budget. We were thinking about putting it in our reauthorization proposal, but Gomperts decided not to because he feared having to refer the bill to hostile tax committees. Second, Harris may propose that we require more work-study jobs to be service. | recall that you have not been enthusiastic about that idea in the past. The Education Dept. and the higher ed community doesn't like the idea, and | know it risks too much pressure when added to America Reads and the college-school partnerships, but | think it has merit on its own. (There is also a disability item he may raise that is still a mystery to me.)	It is possible that some parts of this text could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, this would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication. For example, if the discussion of the proposed policy changes was part of an internal deliberation process, it may be considered privileged. Ultimately, it would be up to the agency to determine whether or not to release this information under FOIA.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The Corporation has accomplished a great deal in the past year, including a growing membership through America Reads and new partnerships with non-profits and faith-based groups; the service summit last April; and the launch of the new high school service scholars program.	No, this statement does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 generally applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. This statement appears to be a summary of the Corporation's accomplishments and does not involve any internal agency communications or decision-making processes.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Reauthorization of the Corporation for National Service: This is the Corporation's top priority for this year, and Harris will ask you for your active assistance. He will ask you to send a strong signal to the bipartisan Congressional leadership and the Chairs and Ranking Members of the authorizing committees, as well as key White House offices, that reauthorization is a high priority for your Administration. One option is to hold an event in the next few weeks when we officially transmit our legislation to the Hill.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents. It is a communication between individuals outside of the government and does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Through the service summit and other vehicles, Harris has reached out extensively to Republicans and to those who have not traditionally supported national service in an effort to build bridges between the service and volunteer sectors. While he has made progress, it is not clear which Republicans have joined our cause and would agree to speak out on behalf of reauthorization. General Powell has done PSA's for AmeriCorps and speaks very positively about the program, but he might not agree to endorse legislation. Harris would like to reach out to the “civic renewal/compassionate conservatives” in Congress such as Sen. Coats to seek ways to work together on citizen service that go beyond AmeriCorps, but which will smooth the path for reauthorization.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege, deliberative process privilege, and executive privilege. The passage discusses internal strategy and outreach efforts, which could be considered part of the agency's deliberative process. However, whether or not this information is actually protected would depend on the specific circumstances and context of the communication.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Harris may also raise two related items: legislation to exempt AmeriCorps education awards from income tax, and making it more attractive for individuals with disabilities to participate in AmeriCorps. The Corporation decided to drop the tax proposal from its reauthorization proposal late last year because of fears that it would bog down reauthorization. It has a small cost.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications and deliberative process privilege. However, without more information about the specific context and nature of the communication, it is difficult to determine definitively whether exemption 5 would apply.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; One America: Harris wants to follow up on your “One America” theme from the State of the Union, where you spoke about how citizen service can help us create a common identity, and gave as examples the military, the Peace Corps, and AmeriCorps. He will suggest a White House event (either a Conference or other form of interactive event) in which people from the military, the Peace Corps, and especially young people engaged in national service can draw attention to the ways in which their shared endeavors have led to greater understanding across racial and other differences. Obviously, we would want to work with the Race Initiative and others in creating such an event, but we would look to highlight AmeriCorps and other forms of national service (especially youth service) in this event.	It is possible that this could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. However, it would depend on the specific context and content of the communication, as well as any applicable case law or legal precedent.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In addition, Harris may raise the following issues with you: National Volunteer Week: Harris will want us to highlight National Volunteer Week and National Youth Service Day in April to draw attention to the value of youth service. Like the Martin Luther King Day of Service, this annual event is an occasion to showcase AmeriCorps and national service, and will take place around the time of the one-year anniversary of the service summit in Philadelphia. The Corporation might propose that you serve with AmeriCorps, or that you speak out about programs that encourage and reward youth service such as your high school service scholars program (which we hope to expand to 10,000 high schools this year), or the new President's Student Service Awards.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the communication.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Work Study: Harris may raise the option of dedicating more work-study funds to service. He will acknowledge that the Department of Education and the higher education community are not enthusiastic about this idea, but he feels that work-study could be a key tool to make youth service more universal and build on the success of America Reads.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the statement. If it was part of an internal discussion or deliberation within a government agency, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. If it was a public statement made by a government official, it would likely not be protected under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Dear Mr. President, As [ alerted you at Cardozo, this missive is inspired by Andrew Marvel’s 17° century poem about “time’s winged chariot,” and by the realization that you have a little more than a thousand days left in your presidency.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any information related to deliberative processes or attorney-client privilege.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Had we but world enough, and time, This coyness, Lady, were no-crime... But at my back I always hear Time's winged chariot hurrying near, And yonder all before us lie Deserts of vast eternity.	No, the given text is not protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, or attorney work product. The given text is a poem by Andrew Marvell and does not fall under any of the categories protected by exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Now therefore, while the youthful hue Sits on thy skin like morning dew... Rather at once our time devour Than languish in his slow-chapt power. Let us roll all our strength and all Our sweetness up into one ball... Thus, though we cannot make our sun Stand still, yet we will make him run.	No, this passage is not protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This passage appears to be a poem or literary work and does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; As you may guess, my proposition is that the time has come for you to do everything in your power to roll all your “strength” and all your “sweetness” up into one ball. And that the time to begin trying to do that is your State of the Union address. My pitch goes beyond AmeriCorps and national service — though they are central and the reauthorization for the Corporation for National Service needs your championship in the address to Congress and months to follow. I write here not so much as an agent for AmeriCorps but, if I may be so bold, as a coach for America’s future and for the next thousand days of your Presidency.	It is unlikely that this would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not appear to be a communication that is privileged or confidential, nor does it contain pre-decisional or deliberative information.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; As an old civil rights hand and a veteran not only of national service, but also of the Peace Corps and higher education over the years, I see you on the brink of truly becoming the Education President, the Citizen Service President, and the President who leads us into the new millennium on the road to One America. The three themes of education, service and One America already run through your record as President and in the years before that. They are three themes that people know run deep in you. They are your special trinity.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any deliberative process or decision-making within a government agency. It is a personal opinion and praise for the President's record and values.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Now is the time, in an even fuller and stronger measure, to roll your efforts in these three vital areas into one commanding vision and one unified strategy. If you succeed, the whole will be recognized as far greater than the sum of the parts. The parts are not small, but so far most people fail to see how they come together in something very powerful and fundamental.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any information related to deliberative processes or attorney-client privilege.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; As of now, one might predict that historians will acknowledge you as a President who, with indomitable spirit, under unprecedented continuous assault, made progress in many increments on many different fronts. If that is all you did, it would be very good. But what I imagine, and more importantly what the spirit of the nation needs, is far more — that you speak and act in these next three years so you stand tall in history as the one who in the last half of this century ushered in a truly great transformation.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any deliberative process or decision-making within a government agency. It is a personal opinion or prediction about the actions of a public figure.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Roosevelt led such a transformation in the crucible of the Great Depression. Lincoln did it in the Civil War. You can do it in our more complicated time, even though, as you have noted, it is very difficult when there is not an inescapable, galvanizing crisis.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any privileged communication or deliberative process of a government agency. It is a general statement about historical figures and their leadership during times of crisis.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Yet, as you know, there is a quiet crisis of the American spirit — the civic spirit that made America great. There is the slow-burning crisis of American youth — especially for the 15 million or more who lack the fundamentals for success. There is the profound crisis of American unity — of the two cities of rich and poor, and the divisions of race.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any privileged communication or deliberative process of a government agency. It is a general statement about societal issues.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; To galvanize the country for action to deal with this compound crisis, I urge you to embrace the strategy we used to organize the Presidents’ Summit — which is now our strategy in the post-summit campaign for America’s Promise. That is, to focus on the key problems for children and youth and work to bring together all the forces of our society, including citizen service and government at all levels, to solve these problems. And to do it by embracing and giving priority to the measurable goals set at the summit, around which America’s Promise and our national service network are mobilizing people, state-by-state, and community-bycommunity.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications, attorney-client privilege, or deliberative process privilege.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The Five Summit Goals encompass the themes of good education for ail, citizen service for youth and service by all young people, and common work by young and old, across all the lines that divide us, to build One America. The Goals include a healthy start and access to health care for all children, which is also needed to make America one, and for which you have also done so much.	No, this statement does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies. This statement appears to be a general statement about goals and initiatives, rather than a communication between government officials.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; And the overarching vision is the one you have been articulating so well - One America. It is that vision which connects the three themes. Education is the great equalizer, but to achieve One America that succeeds in self-government, it must be education in the full sense, not just in the classroom and in training for jobs. It must also be education in citizenship, in the ethic and practice of citizen service.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications, attorney-client privilege, or deliberative process privilege.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Morally and strategically this focus on children and youth, on their education and on service to and by youth, is the right strategy for our time. It is a common ground on which people of common sense can rally for the common good.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any privileged communication or deliberative process of a government agency.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; When Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were killed the goals set by the Summit were the ones they were pointing to. The nation has paid a terrible price in not achieving those goals for millions of young people who came of age in the last thirty years. If you use the Bully Pulpit of the Presidency, with all your extraordinary power of persuasion, you can make the next years the beginning of Civil Rights II.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications, pre-decisional or deliberative material, attorney-client privilege, or certain classified information.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In delivering his Dream on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, Martin said, “We have come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now.” And he spelled out our mission: “ Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity for all of God’s children.”	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it is a public speech made by Martin Luther King Jr. and is not related to any internal government communication or decision-making process.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The Capitol is not so hallowed a spot, but the State of the Union is the right occasion to summon up the “better angels of our nature.”	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any privileged or confidential government communication or information.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; You conveyed so well the essence and centrality of this vision and strategy in your from-the-heart, stirring words to the volunteers at Cardozo. You also articulated this clearly in your December interview with the New York Times, when you said your Race Initiative “needs to be seen in the context also of what I have tried to do since I got here on citizen service, the whole idea of AmeriCorps, participating in the Presidents’ Summit on Service, all that.” And your goal in a “larger sense,” you said is, “to create an ethic of service across racial lines so that when we begin this new century and when I leave office and go off into the sunset, the typical American will have at least three opportunities for constructive engagement with people of other races — one at work, one at school, and one in community service working on common problems. So I intend to try to work to sort of integrate all that.”	It is possible that this could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the communication.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; With the vision of One America and that strategy for education and service, and with your strong and sustained leadership, I believe you can yet bring this country together around the great, unifying national cause we need.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications, attorney-client privilege, or deliberative process privilege.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; FYI, Maria Echaveste has been pushing for an 800 number for the state of the union where the President could refer people who want to volunteer, in connection with the race initiative. The Corporation for National Service told her it couldn't do this, particularly on such short notice, but suggested creating a Corp. web site that would point potential volunteers to existing web sites of the United Way, the big youth service group, United Way, America's Promise, etc. So we'll see. (Previously, Maria tried to get religious orgs to agree to offer service opportunities, but didn't get much response.)	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication. If it was a confidential discussion between government officials about a policy proposal or decision, it may be exempt. If it was simply a report of a conversation with a non-governmental organization, it may not be exempt.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; | hear that Communications may push to do the radio address on MLK Day and service. Since we have the service project on Monday, that may be overkill, so I'm certainly not pushing it. But, if it becomes the best option, here are my best policy announcements {they're pretty small):	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer as to whether the mentioned communication would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. However, exemption 5 generally covers privileged communications, such as those involving attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The content of the communication provided does not appear to fall under these categories, but it is ultimately up to the agency to determine if the information is exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 1. President's Youth Service Awards -- The Corporation i i h these; | sent you a note on this the other day. But the First Lady may be planning to announce this in her column, so we'd have to call that off.	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer as to whether the mentioned information would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. However, exemption 5 generally covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and deliberative process privilege. Whether the information in question falls under any of these categories would depend on the specific circumstances and context of the communication.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 2. AmeriCorps has a study it hasn't formally released on diversity in AmeriCorps. It's pretty boring -- qualitative stuff about who benefits from diversity and how to support diversity. More interesting is a PC how-to manual by the study authors with examples from successful service programs. The Corporation's conclusion from the study is that national service gives participants a greater respect for others. :	It is possible that the PC how-to manual and examples from successful service programs could be protected under FOIA exemption 5 if they are considered pre-decisional and deliberative. However, the Corporation's conclusion from the study would likely not be protected under this exemption as it is a final agency decision.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 3. The Presidential Memorandum asking agencies to report on how they support employees to want to volunteer during the work day is about to go out.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents that are typically protected under this exemption.
D1//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 4. We could see if Harris is comfortable announcing a ""Saturdays of service"" program for AmeriCorps NCCC, similar to CityYear's Young Heroes, where AmeriCorps and JH students work together on Saturdays."	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the statement. If it was made as part of a deliberative process within a government agency, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
T0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; I think this is an easy call, but let me know asap if the following raises any red flags.	As an AI language model, I do not have the context to determine whether the information provided would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Please provide more information or consult a legal expert for guidance.
T0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Harris sent a Dec. 31 memo to the President in which he says the Corporation will relaunch the President's Youth Service Awards. These awards are essentially a certificate similar to the Président's Physical Fitness Award, and would go to any youngster who could demonstrate that they completed 100 hours ice ina year (part of the summit's goal 5). There is no cost. The program has bipartisan support. But it was suspended in March 1994 after a negative IG report on how it was being administered.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The memo from Harris to the President could be considered an internal communication within the Corporation for National and Community Service, and therefore potentially exempt from disclosure. However, the ultimate determination of whether this information is exempt would depend on the specific circumstances and legal analysis of the case.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Apparently Gomperts told Melanne about the idea, and my second-hand information is that she liked it very much and the First Lady is seriously considering mentioning it in this week's column, which has a deadline of Thursday. So if there are any problems, we should surface them now.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; {The other obvious question is whether we should hold this for him to announce at the service event on MLK Day, but this doesn't seem so appeating, and it's not clear we want an announcement.)	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process privilege. This statement does not fall under either of those categories.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Here's a draft memo on Harris's proposal to resume the Dail i i s. Let me know whether you want the memo to come from you, and whether you want to recommend an option -| know you've said you really don't care in the past. Steve Silverman would probably be willing to send the memo if you don't want to.	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer without additional context. However, based on the information provided, it is possible that the draft memo could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch, including inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; This draft identifies a middle ground option between resuming and not resuming the awards, which is resuming them but not linking them to the President. It's been hard to get closure on where people are on this issue, but I think Ann Lewis opposes it, while Steve Silverman thinks we should do something here. Harris says that the former President will be very disappointed if we reject this idea.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the creation and distribution of this draft. If it was part of an ongoing internal deliberation process, it may be considered privileged. If it was already publicly disclosed or shared with outside parties, it may not be protected. Ultimately, the determination of whether this information is exempt from FOIA would be made by the agency in question or a court.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Background: Harris Wofford has written to urge that you resume former President Bush’s “ Daily Points of Light” awards. He proposes to rename the awards the “Presidents’ [plural] Points of Light,” with you and President Bush as co-sponsors. Rather than having the White House take responsibility for selecting and vetting the winners on a daily basis, as was the case under President Bush, Harris proposes that the Points of Light Foundation and the Corporation for National Service take on this responsibility. The Knights of Columbus have agreed to fund the costs of this program for one year.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; One factor complicating the decision is that Harris has had extensive conversations with the Points of Light Foundation and with President Bush himself on this proposal. Apparently Harris has made it clear that he favors this idea and that the decision rests with the White House. Harris indicates that President Bush will be deeply disappointed if we decide not to resume the awards.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The fact that Harris has had conversations with the Points of Light Foundation and with President Bush himself suggests that these communications may be privileged and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, the specific circumstances and context of these conversations would need to be further evaluated to determine if they meet the criteria for exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; One other timing issue is that you are scheduled to attend the dedication of President Bush’s library in November. If we decide to reinstate this program, that event would be an opportunity to announce it, especially given the former President’s attachment to the Points of Light program.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the statement. If it was part of a deliberative process or involved legal advice, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. If it was simply a logistical or scheduling matter, it may not be exempt. Ultimately, it would be up to the agency to determine whether or not to release the information.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Arguments For: Reinstating the awards is an easy way to keep the issue of service and volunteerism before the public on a daily basis. It would continue to repair the rift between the AmeriCorps concept of service and the more traditional volunteer sector, just as the Philadelphia summit did. AmeriCorps members would be eligible for the awards.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The arguments presented here could potentially fall under the deliberative process privilege, which protects communications that are part of the decision-making process and are pre-decisional in nature. However, whether or not this information would actually be protected would depend on the specific circumstances and context in which it was created and communicated.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; President Bush very much wants the Administration to do this. He will be very disappointed if we do not, and he will see it as the White House’s decision because of Harris’ conversations with him.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or deliberations. It is a statement about the President's desires and reactions, which are not related to the decision-making process within the government.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Arguments Against: The benefits of resuming the awards are minimal. Our efforts to reach out to the volunteer sector at the Philadelphia summit were so successful that it is not clear what this would add. In addition, some would react negatively to such a decision, since the original Points of Light program was derided by many as an empty gesture.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. The arguments against resuming the awards do not fall under this category as they do not involve the development or formation of policy or decisions.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The daily responsibility of selecting and vetting winners will be time-consuming for White House staff, and not worth the effort. Although theoretically we could assign responsibility for vetting the award winners to the Points of Light Foundation and the Corporation for National Service, from a practical standpoint we would probably still feel the need to do a legal and/or political check on award winners.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The statement discusses the practical considerations and potential legal and political implications of a decision, which could be considered part of the agency's decision-making process and therefore privileged. However, the specific circumstances and context of the statement would need to be evaluated to determine if exemption 5 applies.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Options: Resume the awards as Wofford proposes.	No, this statement does not appear to be related to any of the FOIA exemption 5 categories, which include privileged communications within or between agencies, pre-decisional and deliberative materials, and certain types of agency memoranda.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Decline to resume the awards.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any inter-agency or intra-agency communication or document. It is a simple statement and does not involve any deliberative process or decision-making.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Reestablish these awards as the “Daily Points of Light” awards, administered by the Corporation and the Points of Light Foundation, with no connection to the President or the White House. It is not clear how President Bush would react to such a plan.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any deliberative process or communication within an agency.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Several members of the press are planning stories on progress in the 6 months since the service summit. The Times already did one, and the Boston Globe is working on one that may not be positive; it may already have been in the press this weekend. Jonathan Alter will do one that people suspect will be critical. America's Promise is trying to respond by putting together a 6-month update that Powell will reveal in some setting later this month. They have asked all commitment makers for media-oriented nuggets they could use. (I am putting together a package for them on federal agency commitments.} America's Promisé remains in a state of flux. They still have not developed their tracking system for commitments, and personnel changes continue.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D1//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Steve Silverman and | have talked about us doing a ""6 month memo” that would lay out our own progress since the summit and talk about where we want to be at the 1-year point. Let me know if you think that's a good or bad idea. Ideas we could develop are outreach on health insurance both Medicaid and the new program; and reauthorization of AmeriCorps. You that  Harris just Sent the President a memo -- it's a general update on the Corporation, wit! making reauthorization a priority by releasing it this year and pushing hard early next year"	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Folks--this issue has been kicking around and getting more momentum. VA has analyzed over the last few years the claims of these Filipinos for benefits as veterans having fought for the US in WWII. I believe the conclusion is that it would be extremely costly but | don't believe the White House has ever engaged in a substantive analysis of the merits of the claim other than the financial cost. | think we need a process to have this resolved--it has gotten on the President's radar screen. | would be happy to coordinate this process, if you'll assign the appropriate staff members for this work. Thank you.	It is possible that this could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication, as well as any applicable case law or legal precedent.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; PURPOSE To announce significant budget initiatives to help break the cycle of crime and drugs. A new Justice Department report, also released today, shows that in 1997 more than threequarters of the nation’s prisoners reported past drug use, more than half reported using drugs in the month before their offense, and one in six committed their crimes so they could purchase drugs. Responding to these findings, you will announce new resources to help states and localities systematically test, treat, and sanction drug-involved offenders -including $215 million in the FY 2000 budget to enforce “zero tolerance” for drug use by prisoners, parolees, and probationers.	It is possible that some portions of this announcement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. However, this would depend on the specific context and content of the communication. For example, if the announcement included internal deliberations or legal advice, those portions may be exempt from disclosure. However, the overall purpose and substance of the announcement would likely not be exempt under this exemption.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; BACKGROUND Today the Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics will release a new study on prisoner drug use (Substance Abuse and Treatment, State and Federal Prisoners, 1997). Key findings regarding prisoner drug use include:	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information in the given background does not fall under this category and should be available for release under FOIA.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Vast majority of all prisoners report drug use. In 1997, 83 percent of state prisoners and 73 percent of federal prisoners reported past drug use -considerably more than the 21 percent of state prisoners and 60 percent of federal prisoners who are serving time for drug offenses. In addition, 57 percent of state prisoners and 45 percent of federal prisoners reported using drugs in the month before their arrest.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Many prisoners commit crimes to buy drugs or while high. Nearly 20 percent of state prisoners and 15 percent of federal inmates reported committing their offense to get money to buy drugs. And 33 percent of state prisoners and 22 percent of federal prisoners were actually under the influence of drugs at the time of their offense.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Drug offenders have long “rap sheets.” State prisoners serving sentences for drug offenses reported extensive criminal histories: 76 percent had been previously sentenced to prison or probation; 54 percent were on probation or parole at the time of their arrest; 45 percent had three or more prior sentences, and 23 percent had previously committed a violent crime. Although federal drug offenders generally reported less severe criminal histories, 59 percent had prior criminal records.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example does not fall under this category.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; You will announce new measures to ensure that the criminal justice system operates to keep offenders drug- and crime-free, including: (1) $215 million in your FY 2000 budget proposal to drug test and treat more people under criminal justice supervision; and (2) the availability of about $120 million in FY 1999 to help make prisoners and parolees drugfree.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; (1) $215 million for the most comprehensive drug supervision ever. Your FY 2000 budget will include $100 million to help states and localities implement tough new systems to drug test, treat,and punish prisoners, parolees, and probationers. This initiative will ensure that states fully implement the comprehensive plans to drug test prisoners and parolees that they are required by law to submit to the Justice Department, while also supporting the efforts of states like Maryland and Connecticut to begin drug testing probationers on a regular basis. Your FY 2000 budget also will include $50 million -- or an increase of 25 percent -- to expand the number of local drug courts and $65 million for residential drug treatment in state prisons.	It is possible that some portions of this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. However, without additional context it is difficult to determine whether any specific information in this statement would qualify for exemption 5 protection.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; (2) About $120 million this year for drug-free prison initiatives. You will announce the availability or release of the following grants to ensure that states fully implement their comprehensive plans for prison drug testing, treatment, and sanctions:	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in this example appears to be a statement of funding and grant availability, which would not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; -- Up to $50 million for prison drug testing and intervention. Today the Justice Department will release new guidance informing states that they can use up to 10 percent of their prison construction funds (Violent Offender Incarceration/Truth-in-Sentencing grants) to drug test and treat prisoners and parolees. Last year, you called on Congress to give the states this flexibility, and he fought for it to be included in the final budget agreement.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the statement is not a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it contain privileged or confidential information.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; -- $63 million for residential drug treatment in state prisons. The Justice Department also will announce the availability of $63 million for state prisons to provide long-term drug treatment and intensive supervision for prisoners with the most serious drug problems.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example is related to a funding announcement and does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; -- $6 million for new Drug-Free Prison initiatives. You will announce that the Office of National Drug Control Policy will award $6 million in grants to help 8 states (AL, AZ, CA, FL, KS, MD, NJ, NY) and the Federal Bureau of Prisons make and keep their prisons drug-free. These grants will support surveillance systems, drug-sniffing K-9 teams, advanced technologies for drug detection, and other efforts to detect and deter drug use in prisons.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and certain law enforcement records. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation and dissemination of this information.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; SEQUENCE OF EVENTS - YOU will be announced onto the stage accompanied by stage participants. - Director McCaffrey will make introductory remarks and introduce the Attorney General. - The Attorney General will make remarks and introduce the Lt. Governor. - The Lt. Governor will make remarks and introduce YOU. - YOU will make remarks and then depart.	No, this sequence of events would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not fall under any of the categories of privileged or confidential information listed under the exemption.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; REMARKS Provided by Speechwriting.	It is possible that the remarks provided by speechwriting could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and attorney work product. If the remarks were created as part of the agency's decision-making process and contain pre-decisional or deliberative information, they may be exempt from disclosure. However, if the remarks are purely factual or have already been publicly released, they may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether the remarks are exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances and context in which they were created.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q The Administration says that it has increased drug testing and treatment in the federal prisons, but the Justice Department report suggests a decrease in inmate treatment since 1991. How do you explain this contradiction?	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve predecisional or deliberative information. It is a question seeking an explanation for a perceived contradiction between two statements.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We have definitely increased the number of federal inmates that are drug tested and treated. The 1994 Crime Act mandated that, by the end of FY 1997, all federal prisoners eligible for residential drug treatment should receive such treatment. As a result, by 1998, the Federal Bureau of Prisons was conducting about 30,000 more drug tests per year and providing residential drug treatment to four times as many prisoners. The number of inmates participating in other types of drug abuse and education programs also increased during this time.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example does not fall under this category and should be available for release under FOIA.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; However, these increases may not have kept pace with the rapid growth in the prison population during that same period. In fact, between 1991 and 1997, the federal prison population grew by well over 50 percent (from 71,000 to about 113,000). Thus, even while more treatment slots were being made available -- and more prisoners were participating in other drug abuse and education programs -- the overall percentage in treatment may have declined.	No, this statement does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies. This statement appears to be a factual observation about the growth of the federal prison population and the availability of treatment programs, rather than a privileged communication.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Finally, it should be noted that the Justice Department report includes a disclaimer saying that -- because the likelihood of receiving treatment increases as a prisoner’s release date approaches -- it may have underestimated the total number of prisoners who will ultimately receive drug treatment.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. This statement is a disclaimer included in a final report and does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q What will the overall increase in funding be for drug testing and treatment as a result of this new initiative?	It is possible that this question could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch, including those related to deliberative processes and attorney-client privilege. If the question is seeking information that is part of ongoing policy discussions or legal advice, it may be exempt from disclosure. However, if the information is already public or does not involve privileged communications, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this question is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances and context in which it was asked.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The “zero tolerance” drug supervision initiative represents a funding enhancement of $112 million for FY 2000. This includes: $100 million in new funds for states and localities to drug test and treat prisoners, parolees, and probationers; an increase of $10 million for additional drug courts (from $40 to $50 million); and an increase of $2 million for the residential drug treatment in state prisons (from $63 million to $65 million).	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications and deliberative process privilege. However, it would depend on the specific context in which this information was created and shared. If it was part of a deliberative process within an agency, it may be protected. If it was simply a public announcement or press release, it would likely not be protected.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; You’ve talked about a “zero tolerance” policy for prisoners and drugs before, as well as requiring states to drug test and treat offenders. What is really new about today’s announcement?	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Today’s announcement takes us a step further in accomplishing comprehensive testing and treatment for offenders in two significant ways. First, the President’s FY 2000 budget initiative proposes over $100 million in new, direct funds for states to carry out their own plans to test and treat prisoners and parolees. And second, these funds can be used, for the first time, to begin to test and treat the over 3 million adult probationers -- two-thirdsof which have serious substance abuse problems.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; What is the average cost of a drug test?	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The average cost of a drug test is not related to these types of communications and would not be exempt from disclosure under this exemption.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The Federal Bureau of Prisons spends less than $9.00 per drug test for the nearly 130,000 drug tests it conducted last year. Costs can vary depending on the number of drugs tested for, procedural requirements, and the number of tests needed (lower quantities will cost more.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The cost of drug tests conducted by the Federal Bureau of Prisons is not a privileged communication and does not fall under this exemption.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Is overall drug use increasing or decreasing? And how does it compare to the statistics contained in today’s report on prisoner drug use?	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to predecisional or deliberative information, attorney-client privilege, or attorney work product.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; According to the most recent National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, there were 13.9 million current drug users in 1997 -- or about half the number of drug users during the peak year of 1979. These nearly 14 million drug users represent about 6 percent of the American population age 12 and older, and the number has remained roughly flat since 1992.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications, deliberations, or documents.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; By comparison, current drug use by prisoners has increased since 1991 and ranges between 5 to 10 times greater than the overall population.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement appears to be a factual statement about drug use among prisoners and does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; But isn’t youth drug use increasing?	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications, such as those between an attorney and client or those that would reveal the agency's decision-making process. This statement does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Not according to the most recent study released by the Department of Health and Human Services. The 1998 Monitoring the Future Survey showed that for the second year in a row, youth drug use, in nearly every category, has either decreased or leveled off among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders. Specifically, marijuana use -- the most widely used drug by teens -- appears to have leveled off, with declines reported for the second year. Just as importantly, youth attitudes toward drugs appear to be turning around, with more young people viewing marijuana use as risky behavior.	No, this statement does not contain information that falls under FOIA exemption 5, which pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; So, while teen drug use remains unacceptably high -- and considerably higher than its low point in 1991 -- we are encouraged by these positive trends.	No, this statement does not contain information that would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications, such as those between an attorney and client or those containing trade secrets. This statement does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D0//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Acknowledge:Atty. Gen. Reno, Gen. McCaffrey, Lt. Gov. Townsend. I want to thank her for pioneering a tough program of drug treatment and testing in her state. Reno Mayor Jeff Griffin, who chairs the Crime Committee at the United States Conference of Mayors. I thank the Mayor and the conference for their leadership; Reno Police Chief Jerry Hoover. Our special guests from Maryland, who have been leaders on these issues: Special Ass’t. Atty. General Francis William Mann; Del. Peter Franchot; Baltimore City Police Commisioner Thomas Fraiser; Baltimore Council Member Rochelle ""Rikki"" Spector."	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government. It is simply a list of individuals who were acknowledged at an event.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Six years ago, America was at peace, but many of our communities were at war. Illegal drugs were ravaging cities on both coasts and in the American heartland in between. Crack and methamphetamine use were at near-epidemic levels. Drug dealers who controlled whole neighborhoods thought nothing of opening fire on passing police cars. Too many communities lived in terror. Too many children feared they would not live to march in their high school graduations.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; I took office determined to give all those children back their futures and ail those communities back their peace of mind. In every successive year of my presidency, I have proposed and passed the largest anti-drug budget ever. Between 1996 and 1999 alone, we have increased funding for anti-drug efforts by more than 30% -- even as we produced the first balanced budget in a generation. And under the leadership of Gen. McCaffrey, we have put these resources to very good use: Unprecedented new tools for domestic law enforcement. Unprecedented new campaigns to convince young people that drugs kill. Unprecedented new efforts to stem the flow of drugs across our borders. Unprecedented new efforts to stop the revolving door between prison and the street, between drug use and criminal activity.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of government decision-making.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; As you've heard from Gens. Reno and McCaffrey, our strategy is working. Not only do we have the lowest crime rates in 25 years. Overall drug use is falling. Even drug-use among young people is beginning to decline.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain predecisional or deliberative information. It is a statement of fact and does not involve any internal government decision-making processes.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; But now is not a time to rest. Now is the time to work harder than ever to build on these very encouraging trends. At this time of prosperity, we have the resources, the proven strategies, and the confidence to make this new year the best year ever for reducing drugs and crime.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of government decision-making.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; I believe that there is no better way to meet this ambitious goal than to expand our efforts to force prisoners to make a clean break from drugs. Today, we are releasing a new study by the Department of Justice that offers even more convincing evidence that drug use stokes all types of crime, from property crimes like burglary and auto theft, to violent crimes like assault and murder. It shows that one in six offenders landed in prison for a crime he committed just to get money for drugs...that nearly a third of prisoners were using drugs at the time they committed their crimes...and that more than 80% of prisoners have a history of drug abuse. There is no question that if we are to continue reducing the rate of crime, we cannot afford to continue releasing criminals with their dangerous drug habits intact.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context in which the statement was made and whether it was considered part of a deliberative process or pre-decisional communication.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; As you have heard from Gens. Reno and McCaffrey, we have already done much to expand drug-testing and treatment in federal prisons and to encourage states to do the same. But today, we will make a quantum leap forward. I am proud to announce that the balanced budget I will submit to Congress will contain a $215 million zero-tolerance drug-supervision initiative, our nation's most comprehensive effort ever to test and treat not only criminals in prison, but also those out on probation and parole. To inmates in every state we will say: If you stay on drugs, then you'll stay behind bars. And to probationers and parolees the message will be equally clear: If you want to keep your freedom, you have to keep free of drugs.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. However, it would depend on the specific context in which this statement was made and whether it was considered part of the deliberative process or pre-decisional communication.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Through this initiative, we will also expand our efforts to help communities build and administer drug courts. As you have heard from Gen. Reno, drug courts are one of the most effective ways of making offenders give up both drugs and a life of crime. When I took office there were four drug courts in operation, including the one Gen. Reno launched in Miami. Today, there are more than 400. And if my budget proposal is approved by Congress, we can have more than a thousand up and running by the end of next year.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Iam also proud to announce that on top of these new budget proposals,we will free another $120 million for drug-free prison initiatives this year -- funds that will help states boost testing and treatment and purge their prisons of drugs with advanced new technologies.	No, this statement does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications, such as those between an attorney and client or those that would reveal the agency's decision-making process. This statement does not appear to fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In these final years of the 20th century, America has made tremendous progress in our efforts to free our children and our communities from the dangerous threat of drugs and crime. Now, as we begin a new century and a new millennium, we have a remarkable opportunity to harness all the resources of our criminal justice system -- our courts, prisons, prosecutors, probation officers, and police -- to break the drug habits of our prisoners, and break the cycle of drugs and crime for all time. Let us seize it. Thank you and God bless you.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of government decision-making. It is a public statement made by a government official and does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D1//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; I've suggested to both MD and ONDCP that they should postpone their 12/9 ""Drug-Free Prisons"" event until the first week in January when we anticipate being able to do a broader coerced abstinence event with new guidance for the use of prison funds, a DOJ report on drug testing/treatment in prisons and ONDCP's drug detection grants. The ONDCP announcement -while not huge -- links nicely with the prison grants and would allow us to show -- exactly a year after the President signed a directive on ""zero tolerance” for drugs in prisons -- that we've made progress on 2 out of the 3 issues we identified at the time: (1) up to $50 million for the 50 states to do more testing and treatment; and (2) $4 million for 8 key states to implement drug detection technologies to keep drugs out of prisons (MD, CA, AZ, AL, FL, NJ, NY and KS). (FYI: The third issue was increased penalties, at the state level, for trafficking drugs into prisons.)"	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances and context of the communication.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Should we also have cabinet affairs or someone else reach out to McCaffrey's folks to make the same request?	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve the deliberative process of an agency or the communication of advice between government officials.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In his radio address to the nation, the President will announce the findings of a Justice Department study showing that in 9 of 23 cities the number of arrestees who tested positive for drug use remained the same or decreased slightly from 1996. This includes New York, Chicago and Detroit - where cocaine use is declining, marijuana is leveling off, and methamphetamine (meth) is not a major substance of abuse.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications and deliberative process privilege. However, it would depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the Justice Department study and the decision-making process leading up to the President's announcement. If the information was part of a deliberative process and revealing it would harm the agency's decision-making ability, it may be protected. However, if the information is already publicly available or does not involve privileged communications, it may not be protected.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Additionally, the President will announce: (1) $27 million in grants for more than 150 drug courts that use the full power of the criminal justice system to rid crime-committing addicts of their drug habits; and (2) the availibility of $5 million in grants for local law enforcement agencies to combat methamphetamine trafficking.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Drug Use by Arrestees . Cocaine use decreasing. Cocaine use continues to decline, most dramatically in the West and Northeast -- where use had reached epidemic levels (80% and more) in the late 1980's -- and among younger arrestees. In Detroit and Washington, D.C., only 5% of young adult arrestees tested positive for cocaine, while nearly half of all older arrestees tested positive for that drug.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; . Marijuana use leveling off. After increasing over the past several years, marijuana use by younger arrestees is leveling off. Fifteen of the 23 sites reported drops in marijuana use by younger arrestees -- including substantial drops in Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Omaha, Phoenix, and Washington, D.C.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications, deliberations, or documents.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; . Methamphetamine use rebounds. Meth, which is almost completely absent outside of the West and Southwest, increased in San Diego, Phoenix, San Jose, Portland (OR), Omaha, Dallas and Denver. Previously, meth use had declined over the past 2 years in these cities.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example is not related to any such communication and is therefore not protected under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; . New heroin problem in some cities. Although heroin abuse remains relatively constant and concentrated among older arrestees, this is not true in New Orleans, Philadelphia and St. Louis. Younger arrestees are more likely to test positive for heroin in these 3 cities.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; . The Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program (ADAM). ADAM is conducted by the Department of Justice’s National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and provides drug use trends as well as a critical local perspective to the national drug problem. ADAM data is obtained through drug tests and interviews with a population of arrestees. In 1997, ADAM collected data in 23 major metropolitan sites from 19,736 adult males, 7,547 adult females at 21 sites, 3,686 juvenile males in 12 sites and 647 juvenile girl detainees in 8 sites. To continue to help communities respond to local drug problems, the Administration plans to expand ADAM to a total of 35 cities this year and even more in coming years.	It is possible that ADAM data could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications and deliberative process. However, this would depend on the specific circumstances of the data and how it was collected and used. It is also possible that other FOIA exemptions could apply, such as exemption 7 which covers law enforcement records. Ultimately, the determination of whether ADAM data is exempt from FOIA would need to be made on a case-by-case basis.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; President Clinton: A National Policy on Coerced Abstinence . Expanding drug courts nationwide. Today, the Justice Department will provide $27 million in drug court funding for more than 150 jurisdictions to plan, implement, or enhance new and existing drug courts.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Leading the national drug court effort. Since the creation of President Clinton’s drug court initiative in the 1994 Crime Act, the number of drug courts has grown exponentially.
