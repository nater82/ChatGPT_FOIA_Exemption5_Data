D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; TEXT: I understand from Mike that he prepared a draft proposal for a WH Conference on education and perhaps some other meetings with specific constituencies to include mayors for you to review recently. When do you suppose it will be ready for circulation for comment by IGA and others?    I am hopeful that we may be in a position to announce at least the mayor segment when the President meets with the USCM winter meeting attendees for breakfast in the WH on January 30. Thanks.	It is possible that this text could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The text appears to be discussing a draft proposal for a White House conference on education, which could be considered part of the agency's deliberative process. Additionally, the text mentions the need for review and comments from various parties, which suggests that the proposal is still in a preliminary stage. However, without more context it is difficult to determine whether exemption 5 would apply in this case.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Presidential Directive on Coerced Abstinence in the Criminal Justice System January 12, 1998	The Presidential Directive on Coerced Abstinence in the Criminal Justice System would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This is because the directive is likely to contain internal deliberations and communications between the President and his advisors, which are typically considered privileged and confidential. Additionally, the directive may contain sensitive information related to national security or law enforcement, which could also be protected under exemption 5. Overall, the content of the directive and the context in which it was created suggest that it would be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Announcement     • Today, the President directed the Attorney General to take the necessary steps to: (1) require states to determine the level of drug use in their prisons and report annually on their progress;  (2) grant states the flexibility to use their federal prison funds for drug detection, offender testing and drug treatment; and (3) work """"1th states to enact stiffer penalties for drug trafficking into and within correctional facilities.  The President also announced that his FY 1999 budget will include nearly $200 million for a series of initiatives to promote coerced abstinence and treatment in the criminal justice system."	The announcement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents that are pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. The announcement is a public statement made by the President and does not involve any internal government communications or documents.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Towards a National Policy of Coerced Abstinence     • Last week, Columbia University's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) released a study confirming the need for coerced abstinence and treatment in the criminal justice system. CASA's study found that 1.4 million offenders -- or 80% of the I. 7 million criminals in prison and jails -- were either high on drugs or alcohol when arrested, stole property to buy drugs, or have a history of drug and alcohol abuse. Many other studies also confirm that the majority of individuals in the criminal justice system have similar drug histories.	"No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" This passage does not appear to be a memorandum or letter between agencies or within an agency, and it does not appear to be related to ongoing litigation."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     • Testing to Measure Progress.  Under current law and federal guidelines, states are required to submit drug testing and intervention plans for their federal prison grant funding. The President's directive calls on the Attorney General to amend the guidelines to require states to also include a baseline report of their prison drug  abuse problem, and to report every year thereafter to chart the progress they are making to reduce drug use and availability. The directive also encourages states to expand their efforts to include other offenders involved in the criminal justice system	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The directive from the President to the Attorney General could be considered an internal communication within the executive branch, and the drug testing and intervention plans submitted by states could be considered privileged information related to law enforcement or national security. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances and whether the government could demonstrate that disclosure of this information would harm the deliberative process or other interests protected by exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     • Helping States Get the Job Done. Today's directive asks the Attorney General to draft and transmit to the Congress legislation that will grant states the flexibility to use their federal prison construction and substance abuse treatment funds to provide the full range of drug testing, sanctions and treatment for offenders under criminal justice supervision. With this added flexibility, states could tap into the nearly $8 billion in prison funds authorized by the 1994 Crime Law (about $2 billion of which already have been appropriated to date).	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it contain privileged information. It is a directive from the President to the Attorney General regarding proposed legislation, which would not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     • Keeping Drugs Out of Prisons. Finally, the President's directive calls on the Attorney General to work with the states to enhance their penalties for drug trafficking into and within correctional facilities. The 1994 Omnibus Crime Bill contains tough penalties for similar crimes. The President believes we must have ""zero tolerance"" for drug use and trafficking within our nation's prison system. Automated Records Management System Hex-Dump Conversion"	No, the statement about keeping drugs out of prisons and the President's directive would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement about drug trafficking and penalties does not fall under this category and would likely be subject to disclosure under FOIA. However, the mention of the Automated Records Management System Hex-Dump Conversion may potentially be protected under exemption 5 if it pertains to privileged communications or deliberative processes.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A Record of Accomplishment     • President Clinton has consistently promoted a policy of drug testing, sanctions and treatment for offenders.  Specifically, he has:	No, the following would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are privileged and would not be available to a party in litigation. The Record of Accomplishment mentioned in the statement is a public record and does not fall under the category of privileged communication between agencies or within an agency. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Pushed for Drug Testing and Intervention in the 50 States.  The  President  fought for and signed the legislation  requiring states to drug test prisoners  and  parolees as  a condition  for  receiving prison grants.        States must now submit comprehensive drug testing and intervention plans for prisoners and parolees by March 1998 and implement  them  by September 1998.   Today's actions directly build on this effort	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be part of a decision-making process. It is a statement about a legislative action taken by the President and its implementation by the states. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Doubled the Number of Federal Arrestees Tested. President Clinton directed the Attorney General to create a program to drug test federal criminal defendants. Operation Drug TEST (Testing, Effective Sanctions and Treatment) was established and funded a pilot program to immediately test defendants upon their arrest. In FY 1997, data from 24 judicial districts indicated that 56% of defendants (9,308) were tested -- a dramatic increase over the 28% (4,929) of defendants tested in the previous year. There was also a 190% increase in drug treatment for defendants over the same period.	"No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.""

Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Expanded Testing and  Treatment  in  Federal  Prisons. Through  his  budgets and the 1994 Crime Act, the President has promoted coerced abstinence in the federal prison system.    In 1997 federal prisoners were subjected to nearly 130,000 drug tests.  Additionally, the number of inmates required to receive treatment increased by 3-fold (from 5,450 in FY 1993 to 17,943 in FY 1997).	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and deliberative process privilege. ; ; If the information in question includes internal discussions or deliberations within the federal prison system about the expansion of drug testing and treatment programs, or legal advice provided to the prison system about implementing these programs, it could potentially be protected under exemption 5. ; ; However, if the information is simply a summary of the number of drug tests conducted and inmates receiving treatment, without any internal discussions or legal advice included, it would likely not be protected under exemption 5 and would be subject to release under FOIA.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Multiplied the Number of Drug Courts.       As part of the 1994 Crime Act, the President fought to launch a $1 billion initiative to spread Drug Courts across the country. Drug Courts use drug testing, sanctions and -- when necessary -­ treatment  to cut  crime and addiction.    Drug Courts have increased from a mere handful in 1993 to more than 200 that are operational today.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement provided does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it involve any decision-making process. It is a statement of fact about the President's initiative to launch Drug Courts and the increase in the number of operational Drug Courts. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Increased  Resources in  FY 1999 Budget.    The President's FY 1999 Budget will continue the Administration's policy of drug testing, sanctions and treatment.  In particular, the budget includes $192 million for the following programs: -- $85 million for a new Drug Testing Initiative -- $30 million to add more Drug Courts -- $4.7 million for Operation Drug Test -- $5 million for demonstration to combat teenage drug use -- $72 million for treatment in state prisons	Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The budget proposal is likely a communication between agencies and contains internal deliberations and recommendations, which are typically protected under this exemption. Additionally, disclosing this information could potentially harm the government's ability to effectively implement its drug policy by revealing its specific plans and strategies.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; ''Zero Tolerance""lnitiative for Drugs in Prison Questions and Answers January 12, 1998"	"It is possible that the ""Zero Tolerance"" initiative for drugs in prison Questions and Answers document could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the document contains internal deliberations or communications between government officials that were intended to be kept confidential, it may be exempt from disclosure. However, if the document contains purely factual information or information that has already been publicly disclosed, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether the document is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific content and context of the document."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Q.  What is the President announcing today?	No, the question would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The question about the President's announcement does not fall under this category and would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     A. Today, the President signed a directive to the Attorney General calling on her to take the necessary steps to:	"It is possible that the statement would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" The statement appears to be a communication between the President and the Attorney General, both of whom are part of the executive branch of government. As such, it could be considered an intra-agency memorandum or letter. Additionally, the statement references ""necessary steps"" that the Attorney General is being directed to take, which could suggest that it contains deliberative or pre-decisional information that is exempt from disclosure under exemption 5. However, the ultimate determination of whether the statement is protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific context and content of the communication."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;         (1) Require states to determine the level of drug use in their prisons and report annually on their progress.   Under current law and federal guidelines, states are required to submit drug testing and intervention plans for their federal prison grant funding. The President's directive calls on the Attorney General to amend the guidelines to require states to also include a baseline report of their prison drug abuse problem, and to report every year thereafter to chart the progress they are making to reduce drug use and availability.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific circumstances of the communication and whether it meets the criteria for exemption 5. If the communication is deemed privileged because it involves the development of policy or legal advice, it may be protected. However, if the communication is simply a report or data collection requirement, it may not be considered privileged and therefore not protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, it would be up to a court to determine whether this information is exempt from FOIA disclosure.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The President also announced that his FY 99 budget will include $] 97 million for a series of initiatives to promote coerced abstinence and treatment in the criminal justice system-­ including $85 million for a new drug testing and sanctions program for states and localities.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the information was part of internal deliberations or discussions between the President and his advisors, it could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, if the information was already publicly announced by the President, it may not be considered privileged and therefore not protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this information is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances surrounding its creation and dissemination.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Q.  How bad is the problem'! Is this directive really needed?	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, the statement in question does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it involve any deliberative process related to decision-making. It is a simple question and does not contain any privileged information. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A.      While crime rates continue to drop and overall drug use is down, illegal drugs remain an enormous factor  behind  the level of crime and violence  in America.  Drug addicts are involved in approximately 3 to 5 times the  number of criminal  incidents as arrestees  who do not use drugs. Last week, Columbia University's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) released a study confirming the need for coerced abstinence and treatment in the criminal justice system. CASA's study found that 1.4 million offenders -- or 80% of the 1.7 million criminals in prison and jails -- were either high on drugs or alcohol when arrested, stole property to buy drugs, or have a history of drug and alcohol abuse.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The passage provided does not contain any such privileged communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Drug test results and anecdotal information reveal that even while incarcerated, offenders can gain access to drugs. In drug tests conducted last year, approximately 2 percent of offenders in federal prison and roughly 9 percent of inmates in state facilities tested positive for drugs.	No, the information provided would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example does not fall under any of the categories protected by exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; President Clinton believes that our criminal justice system should reduce drug demand -­ not prolong, enhance, or tolerate it. We know that drug testing and treatment can help to break the cycle of drugs and crime.  Convicted offenders who undergo drug testing and treatment while in prisons and after release are approximately twice as likely to stay drug-free and crime-free as those offenders who do not receive drug testing and treatment. Today's directive and the resources proposed in the President's budget will help us get to zero tolerance for drugs in prison and to helps state to cut crime and recidivism linked to drug abuse.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. This statement appears to be a public statement made by President Clinton and does not involve any internal agency communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Q.  How is this different from previous actions taken by this Administration to address this issue? Is this anything new?	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 covers privileged communications, such as those between an attorney and client or those that would reveal the agency's decision-making process. However, the statement in question does not appear to fall under any of these categories and is simply a question about the administration's actions, which does not reveal any privileged information.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A   The President's action today builds on his strong record of accomplishment in this area. In 1996, the President launched the first comprehensive effort to  address  the drug problem in our state criminal justice systems. President Clinton fought for and signed legislation to require states-- whose criminal justice systems  house the vast majority of drug dependent offenders-- to drug test prisoners and parolees as a condition of receiving federal prison grants.    Under the President's initiative, states must submit comprehensive plans of drug testing and intervention for prisoners and parolees by March 1, 1998 and implement them by September 1, 1998.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. This statement is a public statement made by the President and does not involve any internal agency communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Today's directive complements  the President's earlier initiative   by helping us to chart the states' efforts to  reduce drug use and availability in  their prisons.      The directive also makes more resources available to states to help them get the job done	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency that is part of a decision-making process. It is a statement about a directive and its purpose, which does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The President has taken numerous other actions to combat the problem of drug abuse by offenders involved in the criminal justice system including: doubling the number of federal arrestees drug tested in 24 judicial districts; fighting to launch a $1 billion initiative to spread Drug Courts across the country; and expanding drug testing, intervention and treatment in Federal prisons through his budgets and the 1994 Crime Act.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided does not fall under either of these categories and is instead a public statement made by the President regarding actions taken to combat drug abuse. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Q.  Is the federal government tracking the problem of drug use in its own prisons? What are you doing about the drug problem in federal prisons?	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege, work product privilege, or deliberative process privilege. ; ; If the information being requested includes internal discussions or communications about the government's strategy for addressing drug use in federal prisons, or legal advice provided to the government on this issue, it could potentially be protected under the deliberative process privilege. This privilege allows agencies to withhold documents that are part of the decision-making process, in order to encourage open and candid discussions among government officials. ; ; However, if the information being requested is purely factual in nature (such as statistics on drug use in federal prisons), it would likely not be protected under exemption 5 and would be subject to release under FOIA.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A       Under the leadership of Attorney General Reno, the federal Bureau of Prisons is carrying out model programs in drug testing, drug treatment, and drug detection.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement about the Bureau of Prisons' drug programs does not fall under this category and is not related to any privileged or confidential communication.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Drug Testing.   In 1997, federal inmates were subject to 127,460 drug tests. Two percent of tests were positive, as compared to the 9 percent average for state correctional systems. Prisoners testing positive for drugs arc appropriately punished and follow up tests are scheduled regularly to ensure they stay clean. Drug testing of correctional officers, and other selected employees is also an established policy in the Federal Bureau of Prisons.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege, deliberative process privilege, and certain law enforcement records. ; ; The drug testing policy and statistics could potentially fall under the deliberative process privilege, which protects pre-decisional and deliberative communications that are part of the agency's decision-making process. However, this would depend on the specific context in which the information was created and whether it was intended to be part of the agency's decision-making process.; ; Additionally, the information about drug testing of inmates and employees may also be subject to other FOIA exemptions, such as exemption 7, which covers law enforcement records that could reasonably be expected to interfere with ongoing investigations or endanger individuals if disclosed. ; ; Overall, whether this information is protected under FOIA exemption 5 would depend on the specific circumstances and context in which it was created and whether it falls under any other FOIA exemptions.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Drug Treatment. In compliance  with  the 1994 Crime  Law, drug  treatment  is  provided to 100 percent of  eligible inmates prior to their  release from Bureau custody.    In fY 97, nearly 31,000 inmates participated in Bureau treatment  programs.  The number of institutions offering residential treatment has grown from 32 to 42 since FY 1994.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example does not fall under this category and is therefore not exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Drug Detection. Innovative drug detection technology is being piloted at Bureau institutions.   The Office of National Drug Control Policy is working with the Bureau to provide the states with information on Lhe best ways to keep drugs out of prisons.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The fact that the Office of National Drug Control Policy is working with the Bureau suggests that there may be internal deliberations or communications that could be considered privileged. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific content of the information and whether it meets the criteria for exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Q.  Is this new reporting requirement for states on their prison drug problem tantamount to an unfunded mandate on states?	The question would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any inter-agency or intra-agency communication or document. FOIA exemption 5 only applies to documents that are part of the deliberative process of an agency, such as drafts, recommendations, and opinions. The question is a general inquiry and does not involve any internal agency communication.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A.      No. By  law, states  must  develop  and implement  plans  for drug testing  and  intervention as a condition of receiving  federal  prison construction  grants.  Today's action  means  that as part of those plans, states will need to add infornation on their existing prison drug use problem, and update  that  information  annually.  All 50 state correctional  systems conducted  some form  of drug testing on their  inmates  last year;   yet no comprehensive data exists on the prevalence on drug use in state prisons.  Anecdotal  reports  have shown that certain systems, such as the District of Columbia's corrections department, have had difficulty  keeping  drugs out of prisons.   The baseline information they provide  will  help us to chart states' progress to reduce drug use and availability in their prisons.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. The information being discussed pertains to a federal requirement for states to develop and implement plans for drug testing and intervention as a condition of receiving federal prison construction grants. This information is related to a government program and is not likely to be subject to exemption 5, which pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential. Additionally, the information being discussed is related to the prevalence of drug use in state prisons and the progress being made to reduce drug use and availability, which is a matter of public interest and not likely to be protected under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; In order to provide additional resources for states to promote coerced abstinence and zero tolerance for drugs, the directive calls on the Attorney General to develop legislation to allow states to use their federal prison construction and treatment funds to carry out all of these activities.	The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The directive appears to be a communication between government officials discussing potential legislation, which could be considered privileged. However, it is important to note that FOIA exemptions are subject to interpretation and can vary depending on the specific circumstances of the request.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; In addition, the President is proposing $197 million in FY 99 for a series of initiatives to help states promote coerced abstinence and treatment: I) $85 million for a new drug testing, sanctions, and intervention program for states and local criminal justice systems; 2) $30 million for Drug Courts; 3) $4.7 million for the federal Operation Drug Test program; 4) $5 million for a juvenile justice demonstration program to combat teen drug use; and 5) $72 million to continue the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment in State Prisons program.	It is possible that some portions of this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. Specifically, any internal discussions or deliberations about the proposed initiatives could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, the actual details of the proposed initiatives themselves would likely not be protected under exemption 5, as they are not part of any privileged communication.

All Board members will be involved in the effort to identify and recruit leaders.   On the feedback form mentioned in item 2, Board members are encouraged to identify leaders in communities they visit.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of specific individuals and their roles in identifying and recruiting leaders could be considered internal communications within the Advisory Board. However, it would depend on the specific circumstances and context of the information. If the Advisory Board is a public entity and the recruitment efforts are part of their official duties, the information may not be protected. Additionally, if the information is already publicly available or has been disclosed through other means, it may not be protected.

The Board, with staff assistance, will develop a written summary of efforts to promote and sustain dialogue.	Yes, this could potentially be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language used suggests that the Advisory Board and staff are discussing internal strategies and plans for promoting and measuring the effectiveness of their dialogues, which could be considered privileged information. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific context and content of the communications.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     5. Promising Practices	"It is not clear whether ""Promising Practices"" would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 without additional context. Exemption 5 generally applies to privileged communications, such as those between an agency and its attorneys or those that would reveal the agency's decision-making process. If ""Promising Practices"" refers to internal agency communications related to decision-making or legal advice, it may be protected under exemption 5. However, if it refers to general best practices or recommendations that are not part of the agency's decision-making process, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether ""Promising Practices"" is protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific content and context of the information."
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Advisory Board members , during their visits to various communities, will identify promising practices and report them to the Initiative staff. Also, through regular communications with Initiative staff: Board members will receive reports of promising practices for inclusion in speeches as examples of how communities can work toward racial reconciliation. One example could be a reference to Boston' s Team Harmony Project as something that could be replicated elsewhere.	Yes, the statement would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement describes internal communications between Advisory Board members and Initiative staff regarding the identification and reporting of promising practices for racial reconciliation. These communications are likely to be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.

Summaries of Advisory Board Meetings and Town Halls	It is possible that the summaries of Advisory Board Meetings and Town Halls could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the summaries contain confidential or privileged information, such as discussions of legal strategy or internal deliberations, they may be exempt from disclosure. However, if the information in the summaries is purely factual and does not contain any privileged information, it may not be protected under exemption 5 and could be subject to disclosure under FOIA. Ultimately, the determination of whether the summaries are exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific content of the documents and the agency's justification for withholding them.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Following each Advisory Board meeting and Town Hall, Initiative staff will produce a detailed summary of the event, including information gathered, opinions expressed, conclusions  reached, and follow-up planned.    These summaries  will be transmitted  by Dr. Franklin  to the President in a timely fashion.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The detailed summaries produced by Initiative staff and transmitted to the President could be considered privileged communications that are part of the decision-making process and therefore exempt from disclosure under FOIA. Additionally, the fact that the summaries are transmitted directly to the President suggests that they are highly sensitive and confidential.

The current immigration system is set up to favor keeping families intact. Thus, the vast number of legal immigrants are brought to this country through family-based visas, which do  not take into account education or skill level. The article cites a Rand  study proposal  to create a point system of immigration which continues to  give  weight  to  immediate  family  reunification but  would  also give points  for education, language  skills, and work experience. The final report of the Commission on Immigration Reform also recommends a shift  in priority toward  higher skilled immigrants.    Instead creating a point system, the Commission recommends revising skill-based admissions (approximately 100,000 visas) to favor highly-skilled and educated immigrants and eliminating altogether the category of unskilled workers. Though we think that these ideas are well worth exploring, it is unlikely that Congress will want to consider an overhaul of legal immigration this year. Efforts to reduce legal immigration levels were defeated during consideration of the 1996 illegal immigration law.

Adding this proposal to the mix would no doubt create a great deal of public animosity from the employer community. Moreover, in a Republican Congress there is no chance that this would pass and it would likely be characterized as another step to ""take over the health care system.""

We have asked HI-IS to review the extent to which this is occurring. However, it is important to note that many independent policy experts believe that payments to HMOs still are, on average, excessive given the fact that they continue to attract disproportionately healthy populations.  They believe that any movement towards reducing 2 benefits are more attributable to HMO ' s desire for adequate profit margins for their investors rather than adjustments in reimbursement issue. In fact, one corporate executive just informed us that Medicare continues to be their number one most profitable player. Having said that, the fact that the BBA is starting to reduce Medicare reimbursements to HMOs will clearly contribute to lower revenues for these health plans. It is important to note that the added benefits in Medicare HMO plans do help encourage beneficiaries to participate in these plans. The outstanding question is whether or not we want to allow payment rates to exceed what is necessary so as to ensure that these additional benefits are in place. Regardless , any move in this direction would be premature until we have better information about the extent to which HMOs are reducing benefits and the reasons behind such a trend. 3	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

D1			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?

A number of our congressional friends, especially those in the Congressional Women's Caucus, spoke of their concern about this during their one minute floor speeches prior to adjournment.

This statement would likely not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Barry White seems to think that in order to have a strong tie between the new vouchers and welfare to work, the vouchers must be tied specifically to the $3 billion welfare to work program.   As much as I love Barry, I just don't agree.    There is no reason why the public housing authority could not link with a welfare to work program operated by the local TANF agency instead.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement provided is not a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor is it part of a decision-making process. It is simply an opinion expressed by an individual and does not meet the criteria for exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; One reason why Barry may prefer the link to $3 billion program is that those dollars are targetted to   hard-to-employ, long-term recipients.   If we want to target vouchers to long-term recipients, we could do so without requiring that they be long-term recipients in the $3 billion program. Or, as illustrated in our alternative, we could let the local housing authorities propose the program linkage and the individuals to be targetted in their application for vouchers. -----------=-------- ATTACHMENT 1 ==================== ATT CREATION TIME/DATE: 0 00:00:00.00 TEXT: Unable to convert ARMS_EXT:[ATTACH.D29]11AIL403346720.316 to ASCII, The following is a HEX DUMP: FF57504377090000010A020100000002050000005521000000020000004189E2F8224Bl2EA2224 30Cl26FB46FDB8F2El905ED1A07F003966936042009DE8793EDF6939A3765C2AOAD4C35AADSF87	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; We are developing a child care proposal that will help working families afford child care, make targeted investments to improve the safety and quality of child care, particularly for infants and toddlers, and provide safe, constructive activities for school-age children. To help working families afford child care, the proposal: (1) increases funding for federal child care subsidies through the Child Care and Development Block Grant; and (2) changes the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit by raising the percentage of child care expenses  for which a  taxpayer may take a credit and by increasing the income levels of taxpayers who may  claim it. Currently, the credit rate is phased down from 30% for taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $10,000 or less to 20% for taxpayers with AGI above $28,000.  We are considering a series of options, including raising the credit rate from 50% for taxpayers with AGI of $30,000 to 20% for those with AGI above $59,000.)  We are also considering targeted investments to improve  the safety and quality of care.    First, the proposal adds funding to the scholarship program for child care providers, which you announced at the child care conference and  which has  received strong support. Second, it includes a new program that will ensure safety and healthy early learning and development for children in the critical first years. Third, the proposal provides resources for states to improve their enforcement of health and safety standards, and fourth, it funds parent education, research and technology. Finally, the proposal makes safe, constructive activities for youth during after-school hours more available by creating a new program for school age children and by coordinating existing programs.

This would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of government decision-making.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The Administration Announces Actions Responding to President Clinton's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments March 28, 1997	It is possible that the announcement would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, more information would be needed to make a definitive determination. If the announcement contains internal deliberations or legal advice, it may be protected. If it is simply a public statement of actions taken in response to a committee's recommendations, it may not be protected.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Background In January, 1994 President Clinton established the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) to examine reports that the government had supported unethical human radiation experiments and releases of radiation during the Cold War.  He asked ACHRE to uncover the truth, recommend ways to right past wrongs, and suggest ways to make sure the government will not repeat past mistakes.	It is possible that some documents related to the work of the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. For example, if ACHRE received legal advice from government attorneys, those communications could be protected under attorney-client privilege. Similarly, if ACHRE received advice from the White House or other high-level officials, those communications could be protected under executive privilege.; ; However, not all documents related to ACHRE's work would necessarily be protected under exemption 5. For example, factual information gathered by ACHRE, such as testimony from witnesses or scientific data, would not be protected under this exemption. Additionally, any recommendations or findings made by ACHRE would likely be subject to disclosure under FOIA, as they represent the committee's final conclusions and are not privileged communications.; ; Overall, the applicability of exemption 5 to documents related to ACHRE's work would depend on the specific nature of the documents and the context in which they were created.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Io October, 1995 ACHRE issued its report. ACHRE found that the-government had conducted several thousand human radiation experiments from 1945 to 1975 and that the majority advanced biomedical research. The Committee found, however, that some were conducted unethically. For example, scientists injected plutonium into 18 patients without their knowledge, and researchers conducted experiments on indigent patients and children. ACHRE made 18 recommendations to open the public record, protect human subjects of future research, and compensate those wronged by the government's actions.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in this passage does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; In October, 1995 the President received the Advisory Committee's report and made it clear that the report would ""not be left on a shelf to gather dust"" He directed his Cabinet to ""use and build on these recommendations."" Over the past year and a half, the Administration has acted to implement ACHRE's recommendations to improve openness in government, strengthen ethics in human subjects research, and compensate individuals for the government's mistakes."	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it involve any decision-making process. It is a public statement made by the President regarding the implementation of recommendations made by an advisory committee. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Today's Announcement     • The Administration released Building Public Trust, outlining its comprehensive response to the President's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE). The report summarizes actions to address ACHRE's 18 recommendations.	It is possible that this announcement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. If the report contains internal deliberations or communications between government officials regarding the response to ACHRE's recommendations, it could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, if the report simply summarizes the actions taken in response to the recommendations without revealing any privileged information, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this announcement is exempt from FOIA disclosure would depend on the specific content of the report.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     • The Departments of Energy and Justice announced that the government has settled compensation claims with families of all of the known individuals ACHRE recommended for compensation. ACHRE recommended the government compensate the families of 18 subjects of plutonium injection experiments. The government has settled with all 16 families that came forward.	Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The announcement of the settlements likely involves internal agency discussions and decision-making processes, which would be considered privileged. Additionally, the settlements themselves may involve confidential negotiations and agreements between the government and the families, which would also be protected.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     • President Clinton signed a memorandum to strengthen the rights and protections of people participating in secret, government-supported research. ACHRE recommended that subjects of secret experiments have special protections and information. Acting on that recommendation, the President directed agencies today to propose new rules for secret research that would require scientists to: obtain informed consent from all potential subjects of all secret experiments (current rules allow researchers to waive informed consent in certain cases); disclose the identity of the sponsoring agency to potential subjects; and tell potential subjects that an experiment is classified. The new rules would also establish a more independent review process; require the head of the agency conducting secret human research to approve each project; and require permanent records of secret experiments. The President also directed federal agencies to report annually on the number of classified human research projects and the number of subjects in each project. A preliminary review by the Administration's human radiation lnteragency Working Group indicates that the government is not supporting any classified human research at this time; today's directive initiates a formal, routine accounting of secret human studies.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. The information provided in this statement is a final decision made by the President and does not involve any inter-agency or intra-agency communications that would be protected under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     • The Administration announced proposed amendments to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 to compensate hundreds of uranium miners who would not be compensated under current law. ACHRE found that some deserving miners do not qualify for compensation under the Act. The amendments would establish fairer, science­ based criteria for compensation. The Administration will also propose regulatory changes to RECA to facilitate claims processing.	The information provided in this statement does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or contain deliberative process material. However, the statement provided does not appear to contain any such communications. Instead, it simply describes proposed amendments and regulatory changes to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. This information would likely be subject to disclosure under FOIA.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Previous and On-going Actions Described in Building Public Trust Include:	It is possible that the previous and ongoing actions described in Building Public Trust could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications and deliberative process. If the actions described involve internal discussions or decision-making processes within a government agency, they may be considered part of the agency's deliberative process and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, if the actions described are already public knowledge or do not involve internal agency deliberations, they may not be protected under exemption 5 and could be subject to disclosure under FOIA. Ultimately, the determination of whether these actions are exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances and context in which they were described in Building Public Trust.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Actions to Improve Openness in Government.     • ACHRE transferred more than 4,000 cubic feet of documents to the National Archives. The Administration has made 300,000 fully searchable pages of documents available on the Internet, and will add an additional 200,000 pages shortly. The Departments of Energy and Defense have published document search guides.     • The President signed Executive Order 12958 directing Federal agencies to review and declassify thousands of documents, including documents on radiation experiments.	No, the actions described in this passage would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The actions described in this passage involve the transfer of documents to the National Archives, the publication of document search guides, and the signing of an executive order to review and declassify documents. These actions do not involve privileged or confidential communications and therefore would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Actions to Protect human subjects in the future.     • President Clinton established the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) to examine bioethical issues, including human research issues. A subcommittee of NBAC will address certain broad questions raised by ACHRE, including how to strengthen Institutional Review Boards -- the local ethics panels for Federally-sponsored research.     • In October, 1995 President Clinton directed agencies to develop plans to improve their oversight of ethics rules. The agencies have completed their review and upgraded protections, and NBAC will review agency procedures in the coming months.     • Agencies have undertaken nationwide education efforts to raise the profile of ethical considerations, and are funding research to improve our understanding of informed consent.	It is possible that these actions could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The discussions and recommendations made by the National Bioethics Advisory Commission and its subcommittee, as well as the agency plans and procedures developed to improve oversight of ethics rules, could be considered privileged communications related to agency decision-making. However, the nationwide education efforts and research funding may not necessarily be considered privileged communications and could potentially be subject to disclosure under FOIA. Ultimately, it would depend on the specific details and context of the information being requested.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Actions to Right Past Wrongs.     • In October, 1995 President Clinton apologized to subjects of radiation experiments and their families on behalf of an earlier generation of American leadersand citizens; former Energy Secretary O'Leary made apologies in certain individual cases.     • The Administration will propose legislation to make veterans treated with nasopharyngeal radiation eligible for health care services under the Veteran's Administration's Ionizing Radiation Program.	No, the actions to right past wrongs would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The actions described in the statement do not involve any such communications and are instead related to public apologies and proposed legislation. Therefore, they would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.

Regas/OPD/EOP, Elena Kagan/OPD/EOP  Subject: Re: ACHRE EO	It is not possible to determine whether the record would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 based solely on the information provided. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The content of the record is necessary to determine whether it falls under this exemption.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; No problem getting this done by the 25th. We will have the report responding to all 18 recommendations and uranium miner legislation  done too. We'll get back to you with suggestions on briefing -- as you know, O'Leary wanted to be involved in any announcement.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The mention of O'Leary wanting to be involved in any announcement suggests that this communication is part of an internal deliberation process, which would be protected from disclosure under exemption 5. Additionally, the statement implies that there may be sensitive information related to the uranium miner legislation and recommendations, which could also be protected under exemption 5.

Regas/OPD/EOP cc:  Elena Kagan/OPD/EOP Subject: ACHRE EO	It is difficult to determine whether the given information would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 without additional context. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or contain deliberative process material. The content of the communication is not provided, so it is unclear whether it contains privileged or deliberative information. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether it would be protected under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; We   have  tentatively  put   the  ACHRE  EO  on  the  schedule  for  Tues  March  25.    This is the   I Pres's day off, so his only involvement would be to make sure the e.o. got signed sometime that day. Perhaps Pena could go to the WH briefing room to explain the details (unless there's someone better to do it).	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. The language used suggests that this is an internal discussion about scheduling and logistics related to the release of an executive order, which would likely be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under this exemption.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; One issue is not resolved ·• how to make sure the Tuskegee folks don't feel slighted. I argued that ] since this wasn't a POTUS event, that shouldn't  be as difficult•· but we'll have to  deal  with that issue with Ann Lewis somehow. Maybe a stmt goes out on that sometime too (not same day).	The passage would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. However, the passage does not appear to be a communication between government agencies or officials, nor does it involve any pre-decisional or deliberative discussions. It is simply a discussion about how to address a potential issue with a group of people. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; In January 1994, after accounts of Cold War-era experiments involving the effects of radiation on humans came to light, I established an independent Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments to investigate these reports.    I asked the Committee to determine the truth about this dark chapter in our nation's history.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it relate to any decision-making process. It is a statement made by an individual about the establishment of a committee to investigate a historical event.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; After taking extensive testimony and conducting numerous public hearings, the Advisory Committee issued its report in October, 1995. The Committee's report included recommendations to make the record of these experiments open to the public, improve ethics in human research  today, and right the wrongs of the past inflicted on unknowing citizens. In my remarks when I accepted the report, I promised that it would not be left  on the shelf to gather dust. I made a commitment that we would learn from the lessons that the Committee's report offered and use it as a road map  to lead us to better choices in the future.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement does not fall under either of those categories and does not contain any privileged or confidential information.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; This document -- my Administration's response to the Advisory Committee's report -- is a milestone in meeting that commitment. We have actively worked to respond to the important recommendations made by the  Advisory Committee through a special interagency working group. This group includes representatives from the Executive Office of the President, the Departments of Energy, Defense, Health and Human Services, Justice, Veterans Affairs, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Central Intelligence Agency. The Environmental Protection Agency has also joined the effort. This report reflects the joint progress of these agencies to address the Advisory Committee's recommendations.	Yes, this document would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language used in the document suggests that it contains interagency communications and discussions related to the Advisory Committee's report, which could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. Additionally, the fact that a special interagency working group was formed to respond to the recommendations further supports the argument that the document contains privileged communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; My Administration has made significant achievements in opening government and making information more easily available to the citizens to whom it belongs.  Agencies have also improved the protections in place for    subjects  of  future human research. Finally, the Federal government is providing redress to those who have suffered from radiation experiments, as recommended by the Advisory Committee.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. The statement provided does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be pre-decisional or deliberative in nature.

D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; WASHINGTON (AP) President Clinton took steps today to protect those who participate in secret, government-sponsored experiments from mistreatment and assure they are fully informed of the risks. The administration also said it has settled the last of a number of claims, totalling $6.5 million, from families of civilians who were injected with plutonium or uranium as part of secret experiments in the 1940s. The actions are• • designed to increase public trust ... and make our government accountable to the American people,"" said Energy Secretary Federico Pena, whose department has spearheaded the public review of past radiation experiments. Pena said the administration also will ask Congress to expand a program that provides compensation to uranium miners who were exposed to radiation as part of the government nuclear weapons program. He said up to 600 additional miners would be compensated at a cost of about $ 50 million. The plans for giving greater protection to research participants were prompted by recommendations more than a year ago by a presidential commission that investigated the government's use of humans in radiation research during the Cold War years. The advisory panel warned that past excesses might be repeated unless there are new safeguards. The White House said today that Clinton had signed a memorandum ,; strengthening the rights and protections afforded individuals who agree to be subjects of secret, government-supported research. The White House said a review by an interagency task force uncovered no government-supported classified human research at this time. But officials acknowledged that formal accounting for such research needs to be improved. Meanwhile, the White House said it had settled claims with four additional families of 1B individuals who were given plutonium injections as part of 1940s experiments. One victim has not been located and the family of another does not want compensation, said Tara O'Toole, DOE's assistant secretary for environment, safety and health. Associate  Attorney  General  John Dwyer  said the 16 claims        12 of which  totalling  $4.B million  were  made  public last November  total $6.5 million. The government has said it is prepared to provide compensation to the families of 52 other individuals who the advisory commission said were believed to be subjected to improper radiation experiments. The identity of those 52 are not known, and so far no families have come forward, according to the White House. Under the new presidential directive on human research, agencies must develop new rules that clearly require scientists to obtain informed consent from all potential subjects of secret experiments. Currently, such consent may be waived under some circumstances. The president also ordered that any research subject be told the identity of the sponsoring agency and whether the experimentation is classified. The new rules also would require the head of the agency to approve such research and develop a more independent review process than currently provided. Also in response to the October 1995 findings by the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, the president said he will: Ask Congress to broaden a 1990 law that allows compensation to underground uranium miners who became ill because of exposure to radiation. Under current law, hundreds of miners are ineligible for compensation. Will propose legislation to make veterans' health care benefits available to airmen and sailors who were subjects of radioactive nasal treatments more than 50 years ago. The treatments were to prevent broken eardrums during flight or in submarines. Will seek broader epidemiological studies to determine the long-term health impact of nuclear bomb testing during the Cold War to military personnel and civilian populations near the test areas. APNP-03-2B-97 1237EST"	The information in this article would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The article contains information about actions taken by the government to increase public trust and accountability, settle claims related to past radiation experiments, and provide greater protection to research participants. These actions are not privileged communications, but rather public statements and policy decisions made by the government. Therefore, they would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; ACTIONS TO RESPOND TO THE PRESIDENT'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RADIATION EXPERIMENTS QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS (NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION) April 28, 1997	"Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The fact that the document is labeled ""not for distribution"" suggests that it was intended for internal use only, and the subject matter (responding to a presidential advisory committee) suggests that it may contain sensitive or confidential information. Additionally, the document appears to be a Q&A, which could contain deliberative or pre-decisional information that is exempt from disclosure under exemption 5."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Overview of Advisory Committee Scope, Findings, and Recommendations	It is possible that the overview of an advisory committee's scope, findings, and recommendations could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, this would depend on the specific circumstances and content of the overview. If the overview contains confidential or sensitive information that was shared within the agency or between agencies for the purpose of making policy decisions, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. On the other hand, if the information is already publicly available or does not contain sensitive information, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to release the overview would be up to the agency and subject to review by the courts if challenged.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Q: What is the universe of experiments studied by the Advisory Committee?	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege, work product privilege, or deliberative process privilege. ; ; If the Advisory Committee was providing advice or recommendations to an agency, the information about the universe of experiments studied could be considered part of the committee's deliberative process and therefore protected. However, if the information has already been publicly disclosed or is purely factual in nature, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this information is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances and context of the request.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A: The President directed the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) to review government sponsored biomedical experiments on individuals involving intentional exposure to ionizing radiation, focusing on the period from 1944 until 1974. The Committee did not consider common clinical practices that involved incidental exposures to ionizing radiation (e.g. x-rays).	Yes, this would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The President's directive to the ACHRE would likely be considered an internal communication within the executive branch, and therefore exempt from disclosure. Additionally, the ACHRE's decision not to consider certain types of radiation exposure could be considered part of their deliberative process, which is also protected under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The President's charge also covered intentional releases of ionizing radiation designed to test human health effects or to measure the extent of human exposure. The Committee studied a number of populations exposed to radiation during the government's Cold War activities, including veterans of atomic test blasts, western uranium miners, and residents of the Marshall Islands.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. Specifically, if the information was part of internal deliberations or communications related to policy decisions regarding the use of ionizing radiation, it could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, if the information is already publicly available or does not involve privileged communications, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Q: How many experiments does this include?	No, the question does not contain any information that would fall under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The question does not involve any such communication or material.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A: No one knows exactly how many experiments this includes. The Advisory Committee reported that the government had sponsored several thousand human radiation experiments between 1945 and 1974.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided does not fall under this category as it is a factual statement about the number of human radiation experiments sponsored by the government, and does not involve any privileged or confidential communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Q:How many people were involved in these experiments?	It is unlikely that the question would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not pertain to any privileged or confidential communication within the government. The number of people involved in the experiments is a factual piece of information that is not likely to be exempt from disclosure.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A: Because only fragmentary information has survived about many of these experiments it was not possible for the Advisory Committee to estimate how many people were involved.	Yes, this statement could potentially be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement suggests that there may be incomplete or sensitive information related to certain experiments, which could be considered privileged or confidential. However, it ultimately depends on the specific context and content of the information in question.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Q:How many people were harmed in the experiments?	It is possible that this question could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the information being requested is contained in privileged communications, such as internal memos or emails between agency officials discussing the harm caused by the experiments, then it may be exempt from disclosure. However, if the information is not contained in privileged communications and is instead a matter of public record, then it would not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this information is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances of the case and the nature of the information being requested.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A: The Advisory Committee was not in a position to answer this question completely. In general, the Committee found that the majority of experiments they studied involved trace amounts of radiation given to adults, similar to those used in research today. These were unlikely to have caused physical harm. The Committee identified several groups of experiments that may have increased individuals' risks, including total body irradiation experiments on ill patients and iodine-1 31 experiments involving children.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be part of a decision-making process. It is a summary of findings from a committee's study of experiments involving radiation. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Q: How many people were not informed in advance that they were the subject of an experiment?	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege, the deliberative process privilege, and the presidential communications privilege. ; ; If the information about the experiment was discussed within an agency and the decision not to inform certain individuals was part of a deliberative process, then it could potentially be protected under this exemption. However, if the information is already public or does not involve privileged communications, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A: Only very limited documentation about consent in individual experiments has survived and no estimates can be made. Generally, the Committee found that researchers obtained consent from healthy subjects, but not from patient-subjects. The Advisory Committee did look more broadly at issues of informed consent across the government and found that the government did not have comprehensive policies in place before 1974. Although the government has strengthen informed consent procedures significantly since 1974, the Committee recommended -- and the Administration is taking -- additional steps to improve informed consent, including requiring informed consent in all classified research (eliminating a current waiver provision) and studying further the informed consent process.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The passage provided does not contain any such communications, but rather describes the findings and recommendations of a committee.

Ultimately, the determination of whether the question is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific context and content of the information being sought.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A: The Administration has already taken steps in each of these areas. For example, to open up the record, the Administration has put thousands of pages of documents on the Internet and in the National Archives, and has developed document search guides. To better protect human subjects in the future, the President established the National Bioethics Advisory Committee (NBAC) and asked NBAC to examine many of the questions raised by ACHRE. To redress the wrongs of the past, the President apologized to subjects of radiation experiments and their families, and agencies have worked hard to settle compensation claims. These and many other actions responding to the Committee's recommendations are outlined in the report released today.	This statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be pre-decisional or deliberative.

If the question is simply asking for factual information or data related to human research protections, it may not be covered by exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A: A strong system of Federal oversight, education, and sanctions is currently in place to ensure the protection of the subjects of government sponsored human research. The Administration has taken a number of steps to further strengthen protections for human subjects based on the Advisory Committee's recommendations. For example, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission is reviewing Institutional Review Board policies -- IRBs are the local boards that review the ethics of individual research projects. And today the President signed a directive to protect subjects of classified research.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement discusses internal government policies and actions related to human research protections, which could be considered privileged information that is exempt from disclosure. Additionally, the statement references the President's directive to protect subjects of classified research, which could also be considered privileged information.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The Administration is also working to improve the informed consent process. Despite the vigor with which all parties embrace the informed consent process, the Advisory Committee found that little is actually known about the effectiveness of this transaction between researcher and prospective subject. In response, the NIH and the Departments of Energy and Veterans Affairs are initiating research to develop new knowledge about the informed consent process.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement provided does not involve any inter-agency or intra-agency communication and does not relate to the decision-making process.

As such, it could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A: The Advisory Committee recommended the government compensate or consider compensate subjects of certain biomedical experiments. The Department of Justice has worked closely with other Departments to resolve individual claims. As announced today, the Administration has resolved all claims brought forward for experiments the Advisory Committee specifically identified for compensation. The Administration has settled with families of 16 plutonium injection subjects. The plutonium injection cases were singled out by the Advisory Committee as being particularly troubling ethically and deserving of compensation because efforts were made by the government to keep information secret from the subjects or their families to avoid government liabilities or embarrassment. The Advisory Committee also identified two other experiments for compensation (see Recommendation 1 ), but the subjects of those experiments are unknown.	Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The information pertains to internal discussions and recommendations made by the Advisory Committee and the Department of Justice regarding compensation for subjects of biomedical experiments. It is likely that these discussions and recommendations were made in confidence and with the expectation of confidentiality, and therefore fall under the exemption.

Yes, the statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing ongoing internal deliberations and investigations related to potential compensation for certain experiments, which could be considered privileged information. Additionally, the reference to directing detailed questions to the Department of Justice suggests that the information is being treated as confidential and not intended for public release.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Some populations exposed to radiation releases studied by the Committee are already eligible for compensation under existing law, including atomic vets and uranium miners. The Committee recommended certain changes to these programs. The Administration has reviewed and acted on those recommendations. For example, today we are announcing new legislation to improve compensation for uranium miners.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

Additionally, the statement suggests that the communication was productive, which could be seen as further evidence of its privileged nature.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; DOJ and I are planning to put a revised proposal into 0MB review on Friday. The new approach quantifies uncertainties in the claims process, and proposes to give the miners the benefit of the doubt in resolving the uncertainties. This approach avoids the precedential issue that DOJ was concerned about, while expanding the number of miners eligible for compensation. (Miners who fall within this approach would still get partial compensation.)	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be a communication between officials at the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regarding a proposed policy change related to compensation for miners.

All of these political reform issues to me are integrated.  When I became the President, I realized we had great new economic challenges, we had profound social problems, that a lot of these things had to be done by an energized American citizenry, but that our national government_had   role ·to play in moving our country through this period of transition.  And in order to do it, we needed to increase the capacity of the government to do it through political reform, but we also needed, as much as anything else, to increase the confidence of the American people that, at the very least, they could trust the United States government to tell the truth and to do the right things.

That's when I ordered the creation of this committee.   Dr. Faden and the others did a superb job.  They enlisted many of our nation's most significant  and important medical and scientific-ethicists.    They had to determine first whether experiments conducted or sponsored by our government between 1944 and 1974 met the ethical and scientific ·standards of that time and of our time.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; We expect to announce the Administration's response to the Presidential Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments next week. As part of that announcement, the staff is recommending legislation to amend the Radiation Exposure and Compensation Act of 1990 (RECA). There is one outstanding issue with respect to the Administration's bill and,  on Friday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) asked us to seek your  view of  the change  before going ahead.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement discusses internal deliberations and recommendations regarding potential legislation, and the request for input from another agency suggests that this is a privileged communication intended to facilitate decision-making within the government.

Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. The discussion of whether or not to propose compensation for uranium miners with lung cancer involves internal deliberations and decision-making within the Administration, which would likely be considered privileged. Additionally, the potential legal and financial implications of such a proposal could also be considered privileged information.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; BACKGROUND: From the 1940s to the 1960s the United States' nuclear weapons program relied on uranium from mines in the Southwestern United States. Miners working in those mines were exposed to levels of radiation known to be dangerous  because the  United States did not ensure that the mines were adequately ventilated. As a result hundreds of miners contracted or will contract fatal lung cancer.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The information provided in the background is not related to inter-agency or intra-agency communications and does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The Radiation Exposure and Compensation  Act of 1990 (RECA)  provides  for compensation of some miners, as well as those living downwind of nuclear test  sites. Uranium  miners qualify for $100,000 compensation if they were exposed to a certain amount of radiation and they contract lung cancer (almost always fatal).	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the statement is a description of a federal law and its provisions for compensation, which is not a privileged communication or deliberative process material.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) recommended that the President seek legislation that would ""provide compensation to all miners who develop lung cancer after some minimal duration of employment underground..."" Their  recommendation was based, in part, on the conclusion that the actions of the United States with respect to the miners was egregious. The government knowingly allowed the miners to work under conditions likely to cause fatal cancers and neither warned the miners nor took action to mitigate the danger. See ACHRE Final Report, pages 565-582."	The information in this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement is a recommendation made by the ACHRE, a committee that was established by the government to investigate human radiation experiments. The recommendation is based on the committee's findings and conclusions, which were made public in the ACHRE Final Report. Therefore, the information is not privileged and should be subject to disclosure under FOIA.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?

Different aspects of the proposal would address two different populations:	Yes, the information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The fact that the Inter-Agency Working Group on Human Radiation (IAWG) is chaired by DPC staff suggests that the group is composed of representatives from multiple agencies, and the development of proposed legislation would likely involve internal deliberations and communications that are considered privileged. Additionally, the fact that the proposed legislation is in response to ACHRE recommendations on RECA suggests that the information is related to policy-making and decision-making processes, which are also covered under exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     1. Miners for whom the probability is greater  than 50%  that exposure  in the mines caused their disease.  (The calculated  probability  is  population-based and does not account for individual susceptibility.) All agencies in the IAWG support proposing legislation that would affect these miners.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. However, the information provided in this scenario is not a communication between agencies or within an agency, but rather a statement of fact about a group of individuals. Additionally, the information does not appear to be part of any decision-making process, but rather a statement of support for proposed legislation. Therefore, this information would not be protected under exemption 5.

Miners for whom the population analysis suggests that  the  probability  is less than 50% that mining exposure caused the disease. DOJ has expressed concern about proposing legislation that would compensate these miners.	Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of DOJ expressing concern suggests that this information is part of an internal deliberation or decision-making process, which would be considered privileged. Additionally, the information pertains to a sensitive issue (compensation for miners with a potentially work-related disease), which further supports the argument for exemption 5 protection.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     1. Miners with a Probability of Causation of Greater than 50%	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and deliberative process privilege. If the information relates to a decision-making process within a government agency, it may be considered part of the agency's deliberative process and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, if the information is already publicly available or does not relate to a decision-making process, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this information is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances and context in which it was created and used.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The legislative history suggests that Congress intended RECA to provide compensation to uranium miners for whom the probability that their illness was caused by radiation exposure while mining is greater than 50 percent. In. these cases, RECA provides $100,000 in compensation per uranium miner. In practice, RECA does not accomplish this goal because documenting exact exposures is too difficult and because the scientific premises underlying RECA are not accurate. Therefore the current law denies compensation to some miners who clearly should be eligible.	Yes, the statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing internal agency deliberations and analysis of the effectiveness of a specific law, which would likely be considered privileged. Additionally, the statement may contain confidential information related to the scientific premises underlying RECA, which could also be protected under exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A working group of the Department of Justice and the National Cancer Institute analyzed the current compensation scheme and recommended changes to ensure that miners are eligible for compensation if it is more likely than not (probability  >50%)  that  their  lung cancer  was caused by exposure in the mines. The proposed measures provide new, less  burdensome methods for miners to establish that radiation  caused  their illness.  The measures  also expand the list of compensable diseases, based on new scientific evidence.	The information described in the passage would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The working group's analysis and recommendations would likely be considered pre-decisional and deliberative, as they are part of the agency's internal decision-making process and have not yet been finalized or implemented. Additionally, the information may contain confidential scientific or technical data that is exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 4. Therefore, the agency may be able to withhold this information from public disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; All departments in the IAWG agree that the Administration should propose these changes.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The statement suggests that there was internal deliberation and agreement among multiple departments within the government, which could be considered privileged information. Additionally, the statement implies that there may have been discussions about policy proposals or changes, which could also be considered privileged information.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     2. Miners with a Probability of Causation of Less than 50%	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. If the information relates to internal discussions or deliberations about the miners' health and compensation claims, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, if the information is simply a factual determination of the miners' probability of causation, it may not be considered privileged and could be subject to disclosure under FOIA. Ultimately, the determination of whether this information is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances and context in which it was created and maintained.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The AWG has also been considering a proposal to provide  partial  compensation  to miners for whom there is a significant probability that their lung cancer was caused by exposure in the mines, but the probability is less than 50%. DOJ has voiced concerns about this proposal.	The statement may be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of DOJ's concerns suggests that this is an internal discussion within the government, and the deliberative process privilege may apply. This privilege protects pre-decisional communications that are part of the decision-making process, as well as communications that reflect the agency's deliberations about policy or legal matters. However, the specific application of exemption 5 would depend on the context and the specific documents or communications at issue.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Option A:       Propose legislation to provide at least partial compensation ($50,000) to all miners for whom the probability is between 20% and 50% that  their  lung cancer was caused by exposure to radiation in uranium mines. This approach would also include proposing the measures outlined in Section 1, above, for miners with greater than 50% probability.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The proposal for legislation and measures outlined in this statement do not fall under this category and would not be exempt from FOIA.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Option B:       Limit the Administration's proposed legislation to compensation of miners with lung cancer for whom it is more probable  than not that  the cancer  was caused by exposure to radiation in uranium mines (i.e. only propose  measures outlined in Section 1 above).	It is possible that Option B could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. This option appears to be a policy recommendation or legal analysis related to proposed legislation, which could be considered pre-decisional and deliberative. However, the specific context and circumstances of the communication would need to be evaluated to determine if exemption 5 applies.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; DISCUSSION	Unfortunately, there is no context or information provided to determine whether the following would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. It is important to have more information about the content and context of the discussion to determine if it falls under this exemption.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; OPTION A: Expanding compensation to miners should be viewed in the context of the Administration's response to ACHRE more generally. In responding to ACHRE, the Administration's policy has been to be as generous as is reasonable because the government's actions in these cases denied fair protection to individuals, and undermined democratic control over the government. According to ACHRE's chair, Dr. Ruth  Faden, expanded  compensation for uranium miners is one of the most strongly-felt of ACHRE's recommendations.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. The statement appears to be discussing the Administration's policy and decision-making process, which could be considered privileged information. Additionally, the statement references the recommendations of ACHRE, which may also be considered privileged information as it relates to the government's response to a specific issue.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; ACHRE's recommendation to expand compensation without requiring individualized proof of causation is appropriate because of the egregiousness of the government's conduct, the impact  of the increased cancer rates in these communities and the government's  support for studying the miners without taking reasonable steps to reduce the known risk.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be part of a decision-making process. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Without a change, uranium miners who are not now compensated  under RECA  will continue to be held to a higher standard of causation than others who are compensated under RECA. Under RECA, people living downwind  of certain areas are compensated  ($50,000) if they  get  a radiogenic disease--even though the probability is very low (<10%) that the disease  was caused by the government's action. In addition, because RECA is not currently based on a probabilistic standard, a significant number of uranium miners who fall within the 20%-50% probability range in Option A are already eligible for compensation.  Option  A  would overcome some of these inequities.	This statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents. FOIA exemption 5 applies to materials that are part of the decision-making process within an agency, such as drafts, memos, and other internal communications. This statement appears to be a public statement or advocacy for a particular policy change, rather than an internal communication within an agency.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The Clinton Administration has, in certain cases, advocated compensation where there is less than a 50% probability that physical  harm  was caused  by  the government's  action.  First, within the last two months, the government has compensated 13 experimental subjects, as recommended by ACHRE, without any causal link to physical disease. Second, the President announced that children of veterans  exposed  to agent orange  will  be compensated  with medical care if they are born with spina bifida. This decision  was tnade despite the extremely low probability of a connection and in the absence of biological plausibility. ·	This information may not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The information provided in the statement does not appear to be a privileged communication, but rather a description of actions taken by the Clinton Administration. However, other exemptions may apply depending on the specific circumstances of the information requested.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Our current best estimate of the total additional cost of this proposal  combined  with  the changes to RECA that we have already agreed upon is between $13 and $14 million over  the next 20 years. The expected cost of option A is only a fraction of this amount.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be part of the decision-making process. It is simply a statement of estimated costs and does not reveal any privileged or confidential information.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Outside of the DPC staff, this option is strongly supported by DOE. I expect that OSTP will also support this option, and OMB will express a view within the next day or so.	The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing internal agency deliberations and opinions, which are typically protected under this exemption. Additionally, the mention of OMB expressing a view suggests that this is an ongoing decision-making process that is not yet finalized, further supporting the argument for exemption 5 protection.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; OPTION B: (A memo from DOJ making a full argument on this point is attached.]	As an AI language model, I do not have access to the attached memo from DOJ.

The subject matter of the document suggests that it may contain internal deliberations or legal advice related to proposed amendments to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). If the document contains such privileged information, it may be withheld from disclosure under exemption 5. However, without further information about the content of the document, it is impossible to make a definitive determination.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; This responds to your request for the views of the Civil Division on the amendments to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) which would authorize the payment of partial compensation to uranium miners for whom the probability is 50\ or less that their lung cancer was caused by exposure to radiation in the mines.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The communication is between the requester and the Civil Division, which is a component of the Department of Justice. The content of the communication suggests that it involves legal advice or analysis, which is typically considered privileged. Additionally, the fact that the communication is in response to a request for views suggests that it was intended to be confidential and not for public dissemination.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; First, we support the other proposed amendments to RECA because we believe they will result in a fairer program for the claimants. We helped to develop many of these proposals based on our experience in administering the program. We have worked hard to improve the administration of the program and are proud of what we have achieved and fully support the bulk of what has been proposed. We feel, however, that we must object to one of the proposals.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. This statement does not involve any inter-agency or intra-agency communication and does not contain any deliberative information.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The current RECA provisions authorize the payment of $100,000 in compensation to miners who demonstrate that they were exposed to defined minimum levels of radiation. The legislative history of RECA indicates that Congress set the minimum exposure levels to approximate the point where, on average, it was more likely than not the miner's exposure caused his lung cancer; i.e., where the probability of causation was greater than 50%.1 RECA also authorizes the payment of compensation in the amount $50,000 to downwinders, persons who demonstrate that they were physically present in certain specified counties or geographic areas in the States of Arizona, Nevada, and Utah  during periods when atmospheric testing was carried out at the Nevada Test Site, and who suffer from certain statutorily specified radiogenic cancers.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in this passage is factual information about the RECA provisions and their legislative history, and does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 1  we understand that because the minimum exposure levels currently specified in the statute do not accurately reflect a 50% probability of causation for most miners, the Department has proposed legislation to amend RECA to incorporate new, more accurate criteria. We support these proposals.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The statement appears to be discussing internal agency deliberations and decision-making regarding proposed legislation, which would likely be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under this exemption.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; One of the proposed amendments to RECA would add provisions authorizing the payment of compensation in the amount of $50,000 to uranium miners who demonstrate that they were exposed to levels of radiation in the mines at which the probability is only between 20% and 50% that their lung cancer was caused by exposure to radiation in the mines.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications, such as those between an attorney and client or those that would reveal the agency's decision-making process. The proposed amendment to RECA does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; It is our understanding that the rationale for these proposed amendments is to more nearly equalize the treatment of uranium miners and downwinders. Scientific evidence indicates that downwinders were exposed to much lower levels of radiation and, therefore, a much smaller increased risk of cancer, than were uranium miners. Therefore, the argument goes, it is unfair to allow downwinders whose probability of causation is below 50% to recover compensation while denying such recovery to uranium miners.	The passage would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; We believe this reasoning is flawed. If the current scheme is providing payments to individuals whose illnesses more likely than not were not caused by radiation does not justify expanding payments to other individuals whose illnesses were not likely caused by radiation. We do not believe the case has adequately been made to overcompensate the miners which would be favored by the proposed legislation.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Our main concern is that if this legislation is enacted, it can be anticipated that other groups will seek to be included in a similar way. For example, the geographical limits on the downwinder population will be subject to expansion. The counties and geographic areas currently specified in the statute exclude persons in adjacent counties and geographic areas where they were exposed to comparable levels of radiation from the nuclear testing program., Moreover, the costs of an expanding program are difficult to predict. For instance, the initial assessment of the cost of the Black Lung Program proved to be dramatically low.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing internal agency deliberations and concerns about the potential consequences of enacting legislation, which would likely fall under the deliberative process privilege. This privilege protects communications that are part of the decision-making process and are intended to be confidential in order to encourage frank and open discussion among agency officials.
D1			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Very importantly, expansion of the precedent for paying individuals compensation for injuries which, more likely than not, were not caused by the events triggering the compensation program is a profound policy decision. We would draw the policy line short of providing recovery for persons who probably were not injured by the government activities involved. The rule in litigation is that those who sue the government for injuries caused by governmental action must prove that the injuries were caused by the governmental action. [This standard is encompassed in 28 use 1346(b)] In many of these cases the plaintiffs may have a sympathetic case but lack the evidence to prove causation by the preponderance standard. Once the precedent is established that in some “exceptionable"" cases the government, although not legally liable, is willing to legislatively compensate claimants, it will be hard to justify denying compensation to one group of citizens having granted it to others."	This statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not fall under the category of inter-agency or intra-agency communications.

This statement appears to be a policy statement or legal argument, rather than an internal communication between government officials.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Moreover, reducing the level of compensation does not derogate from the adverse consequences. The issue remains whether an individual should receive compensation for injuries most likely unrelated to the activities giving rise to the compensation. The bottom line is the same, the government would provide compensation even though most of the claimants receiving compensation would be compensated for injuries unrelated to the government's conduct. We believe the dangers of allowing compensation in these instances will invite many more such requests.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Having raised these concerns, we recognize that the decision of whether to bestow a new entitlement on a favored group is a policy call and acknowledge that this proposal will be considered by Congress which can weigh these risks in their consideration of the amendment. In administering many of these compensation programs and in generally defending the government against claims of aggrieved citizens, however, we believe that such an extension should not be proposed by the Administration.	Yes, the statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be a communication between government officials discussing a policy decision and weighing the risks and benefits of a proposed amendment. As such, it could be considered part of the deliberative process and therefore exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
D1			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; We do not believe it is good public policy because it creates a new standard of compensation for one specific, favored group of citizens, which is not generally available to others whose claims may; in some instances, be equally or even more compelling. By making exceptions to certain favored groups rather than adhering to requirements equally applicable to everyone injured by the government, we will open a process in which groups may obtain relief more on the basis of their political ability than on the basis of an easily understood and accepted ""more likely than not"" standard. Once this policy Rubicon is crossed it will be easier for each successive group to muster its arguments that it is also deserving of a special exception. Ultimately, such deviation from the standard for ""favored"" groups may undermine the public's faith in the government's commitment to treating all of its citizens equally and undermine the public's support of such compensation programs."

Dr. Fung, who is the chief of transplant surgery at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and the Louisiana Republican have emerged as weeks.' They weren't too thrilled.'' Rep. Livingston disputes that the delay will cost lives, saying that the rules themselves would threaten patients by discouraging donations. ""Distributing organs from a national list and m more-centrahzed locations jeopardizes the liealth of the organ and d1mm1shes the mcenllve for people to donate in the first place,"" he said in a letter to his congressional colleagues last month. In any case, faced by Rep. Livingston's implacable opposition, HHS is striking a more conciliatory tone, trying to fmd ways to make the regulations more alatable.

Reilly Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal NEW YORK - Golden Books Family Entertainment, the struggling children's book publisher, was dealt another blow as its president and second-in-<:ommand, Eric Ellenbogen, resigned unexpectedly to take a job as president and chief executive officer of Marvel Enterprises Inc. Mr. Ellenbogen, 41 years old, came to the company in 1996 as president of its entertainment group, a television and video-based unit. In June, he was named president of the entire company, acting as No. 2 to Richard E. Snyder, the parent's 65-year-old chairman and chief executive. At Marvel, he succeeds Joseph Ahearn, who previously said he would resign as soon as a successor was named. Marvel Enterprises was created in October when Marvel Entertainment Group Inc. emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and merged with Toy Biz Inc. It owns the rights to several comic-book characters including ""Spidennan,"" 11X-Men"" and ""Men in Black,"" as well as Fleer/Skybox, a trading-card maker, and the Panini stickers business. Mr. Ellenbogen was credited with building Broadway Video, a television production and distribution company, which Golden Books acquired in 1996. He directed Broadway's acquisition of crucial film and television libraries, including titles such as ""Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" and ""Lassie."" The company said Mr. Snyder now will directly oversee the entertainment unit, which includes home video, merchandising and licensing. Golden Books' nine-month net loss widened sharply to $70.3 million, or $2.77 a share, and revenue fell to $142 million from $ f70 million. It recently reached a preliminary standstill agreement with a group of bondholders to put off interest payments on $100 million in debt. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Golden Books said there is ""substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern."" The company has warned that possible ""restructuring, reduction of costs and other actions"" could result in substantial year-end charges. Earlier this month, it was notified by the Nasdaq Stock Market about the possible delisting of the company's stock for failure to maintain a closing price of at least $5. The shares could be delisted . as early as Dec. 11, though the company says it plans to ""work with the Nasdaq"" to ensure its continued listing. Shares of Golden Books fell 6.25 cents to 43.75 cents in Nasdaq trading, close to a 52-week low. Marvel rose 6.25 cents to $5.9375 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading. Golden Books said Mr. Ellenbogen won't be replaced and said it will be ""streamlining"" its organization. The company said it will be ""finalizing"" its senior management in the next several weeks."

Explain your reasoning.; ; Credit Markets: With Market Turmoil in the Rearview Mirror, Corporations Drive Forward With Bond Issues By Catherine Valenti and Tom Sullivan Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal Corporations of all stripes rushed to raise money in the bond market, including issuers who just six weeks ago wouldn't have stood a chance of raising funds.   As confidence  continued after the recent financial turmoil, problem-plagued ftanchis marketing company Cendant Corp. sold $1.55 billion ofbon increasing the size from a planned $500 million in response t strong investor demand. In addition, two telecommunications companies sold junk-rated securities to finance the construction new networks. Level 3 Communications Inc., which is using Internet technology, came to market with $500 million of zero-coupon bonds, while Global Crossing Holdings Ltd. sold $500 million of preferred stock to help finance its international fiber-optic links. Despite the rush, there is little sign the current flood of bond issuance will ease. It emerged yesterday that the Seagram Co. is lining up a giant debt offering, likely to come to market in December. Lead manager Goldman, Sachs & Co. is marketing the deal at a size of $2 billion. But there is widespread expectation among people looking at the transaction that the total could be raised to $2.5 billion to $4 billion. Goldman declined to comment on whether the size would be increased. No official confirmation of the use of proceeds was available. However Montreal-based Seagram is completing its acquisition of entertainment company PolyGrarn NV. The acquisition is valued in excess of$10 billion and is expected  to close  Dec. 4. With issuance rapidly making up any ground lost in September and early October, worries about a credit crunch are easing, though some participants say the real test will come after Thanksgiving with Seagram's deal and the $2.5 billion anticipated from Monsanto Co., announced two weeks ago. ""The supply overhang that we saw all year is coming to the market and deals are getting done,"" said Greg Hahn, senior vice president and fixed-income portfolio manager at Conseco Capital Management. ""That's a very healthy sign for the market  right now."" The key to Cendant's deal was the high yield on offer, according to investors. That helped to overcome worries about the accounting scandal that has plagued the company this year. ""Obviously  the company has had its accounting problems, but you can't  beat"" the yield on offer relative to Treasurys, said John Kowalik, senior vice president and portfolio manager at Oppenheimer Funds. ""If you're a yield  buyer, this would qualify as a candidate."" Lead underwriters Chase Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co. said that even at the increased size, demand outstripped  the bonds available.   The company so/d $400 million of two-year notes at a yield 2.875 percentage points more than comparable Treasurys and $1.15 billion of five-year notes at a yield 3.125 percentage points more than Treasurys.    During the four-day roadshow to market the bond deal, syndicate officials said Cendant focused on the strength of its core businesses and strategy. For much of this year, the company's public image has been beset by an accounting scandal that took place at direct marketer CUC International, which merged with HFS Inc. to form Cendant in late 1997. As a further enticement, Cendant  will increase the coupon on the bond deal by 1.5 percentage points if its ratings are downgraded to junk status by both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's. Currently it is rated Baal by Moody's and triple-B by S&P. In the junk market, Global Crossing's offering of senior exchangeable pay-in-kind preferred securities was doubled from its originally planned size. The securities were priced at par with a 10.5% dividend rate. Level 3's deal was its second offering this year. It sold $3 billion of junk bonds in April and these securities have become a market favorite. During the financial crisis of mid-August to mid-October, ""Level 3 became the only bond you could sell because it was a high-yield benchmark,"" said Jerry Paul, high-yield fund manager Invesco Funds Group, ""and it was knocked down unduly."" Level 3, which has a $10 billion capital plan, ""saw a nice window to get some funds and got the money,"" said one person familiar with the deal. Neither Level 3 officials nor lead underwriter Salomon Smith Barney would comment. Here are the details of yesterday's two-year note auction.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION The proposed legislation would give DOJ three new tools to combat the failure of nursing homes and other residential health care facilities to treat residents properly. First, it creates criminal sanctions for organizations or individuals who knowingly and willfully engage  in a pattern of  physical  or mental harm to residents. Second, it would create civil penalties that could be imposed on individuals, facility chains, or management companies if they engage in conduct that results in a pattern of  physical  or mental harm to residents. Third,  it would authorize  DOJ to seek injunctive  relief  against these entities or individuals whenever DOJ has reason to suspect  that  they are engaging  in behavior  that  will  result in harm to physical or mental harm to residents. DOJ would have to consult  with HHS before invoking  its injunctive authority.	"This summary of proposed legislation would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.""

It is a summary of proposed legislation and does not contain any deliberative or pre-decisional information that would be protected under exemption 5."
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; OUTSTANDING ISSUES HHS is primarily concerned about the overlap in enforcement  authority  that these  new provisions would create. As currently drafted, the only area of facility noncompliance that would not pose the problem of overlapping authority for both agencies would be those cases where violations are minimal  or where the harm to residents is isolated. HHS is concerned  that  in situations  where both agencies have an interest in initiating an enforcement action, DOJ will push HCFA to delay its enforcement action, since DOJ's need  to build a solid case for conviction  may not coincide  with  HCFA's  need to act swiftly when needed. In addition, HHS is concerned that  DOJ  will develop  its own quality standards for individual facilities and chains when deciding whether to initiate prosecution, thus requiring facilities to comply with one set of standards developed by HCFA  and another  set of standards developed by DOJ.	The passage may be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. The passage discusses concerns and potential conflicts between two agencies, HHS and DOJ, regarding enforcement actions and quality standards for facilities. These discussions are likely part of the agencies' decision-making process and could be considered deliberative. However, it ultimately depends on the specific context and purpose of the communication.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; DOJ feels that the overlap in enforcement authority is limited to enforcement action in individual facilities. Currently, no one has the authority to prosecute nursing home chains for repeated violations, which this statute would provide to DOJ. In addition, this policy would not preclude  HHS from taking any action to protect the health and safety of residents, and DOJ is willing to codify this in an MOU.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be part of a decision-making process. It is a statement of policy and potential actions, which would not be protected under exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; PROPOSED DPC POSITION Modify the DOJ proposal to limit their new enforcement authority to criminal violations and require HHS to propose new legislation providing the111 with new authority to impose civil penalties. Under this option, the Department of Justice would be allowed to impose new criminal penalties on individuals, facility chains, and management companites who knowingly and willfully engage in a patterns of physical or mental harm to residents. HHS would propose new  legislation creating civil penalties that could be imposed on individuals,  facility chains, or management  companies if they engage in conduct that results in a pattern of physical or mental harm to residents. This compromise provides virtually the same level of enforcement and eliminates the problematic overlap of authority created by the DOJ proposal.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Inclusion in Crime Bill. As a matter of perception, we believe there is a danger in housing a nursing home quality provision  jn the  crime bill.

We recommend pulling the nursing home provision out of the crime bill end sending it up es a stand-alone bill.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

Additionally, it does not appear to be an inter-agency or intra-agency communication.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Referral. The bill would give DOJ the authority to pursue nursing homes without referral from HCFA. We believe this would create significant overlap between HCFA's and DOJ's enforcement . actions and could impede HCFA's actions to improve quality. We are also concerned  that, because  DOJ would exercise its authority through its US Attorney's offices, there would not be a consistent application of quality standards. We recommend that DOJ have the authority to pursue nursing homes only upon referral from HCFA or with the explicit approval of HCFA.    We be/,eve them proWsions should be mcluded as part of the actual bill, rather than as an MOU.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

This type of communication is typically considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Chains vs. Individual Facilities. The bill would give DOJ civil authority to pursue both nursing home chains and individual facilities. We believe HCFA should have primary civil authority in cases involving individual facilities, and we recommend that ives DOJ civil aut onty over individual facilities.  DOJ would continue to have civil authority through the False Claims Act, upon referral from HCFA. DOJ's  proposal  would impede HCFA's ability  to en'fori:e quality through CMPs, including the use of HCFA's new CMP per-instance CMP authority. For nursing home chains, we believe DOJ should have civil authority to pursue nursing home chains only upon referral from HCFA or with the explicit approval of HCFA.

The HCFA win: (I) Terminate federal nursing home inspection funding to states with consistently poor records; (2) Increase oversight of state inspections; (3) Ensure that nursing homes are in compliance with standards before lifting sanctions;     • Publishing Nursing Home Survey Results On The Internet;     • Preventing Bed Sores Dehydration. and Malnutrition by requiring state surveyors to monitor actions taken by nursing homes to prevent these ailments;     • Implementing New Efforts To Measure And Monitor Nursing Home Quality. This month, the HCFA began conecting information on resident care through a national automated data system that will be analyzed to identify potential areas of inadequate care in nursing homes and to assess performance in critical areas.	It is possible that some aspects of this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. For example, any internal discussions or deliberations about implementing these policies could be considered privileged. However, the actual policies themselves and any data or reports related to their implementation would likely not be protected under exemption 5.
T0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; THE   WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON	It is not possible to determine whether the given text would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not provide any information about the content of the document. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and attorney work product. Without knowing the content of the document, it is impossible to determine whether it falls under any of these categories.
T0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;                                      July 20, 1998	As an AI language model, I do not have access to the specific content of the document in question. However, FOIA exemption 5 generally applies to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications, deliberative process materials, and certain law enforcement records. Whether or not the document in question is protected under exemption 5 would depend on its specific content and context.
T0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; NURSING HOME ANNOUNCEMENT DATE: LOCATION: BRIEFING TIME: EVENT TIME: FROM: July 21, 1998 Oval Office 2:30 pm 3:00pm Bruce Reed/Chris Jennings	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, without additional context it is difficult to determine whether this announcement is related to privileged agency communications or if it is simply a public announcement of a nursing home event.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;         I. PURPOSE To highlight your commitment to improve the quality of nursing homes by announcing tough new legislative and administrative actions.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, the statement provided does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it contain any deliberative information that would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. It is a public statement announcing new legislative and administrative actions, which would not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;         II. BACKGROUND There are approximately 16,800 nursing homes in the United States, serving 1.6 million people. Since HCFA put new regulations in place in 1995, the health and safety of nursing homes has improved. But Senator Grassley will unveil a report next week on the shortcomings in nursing home care, and HCFA will transmit a report to Congress tomorrow concluding that tougher enforcement is needed to ensure high quality in all nursing homes. You will respond to both of these reports with a tough new initiative to crack down on bad apple nursing homes and ensure high quality care.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in this passage does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it contain privileged or confidential information. It is simply a statement of facts and plans for a new initiative.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; New Legislation to Improve the Quality of Nursing Homes. You will announce that you are transmitting legislation to the Hill this week that calls for:	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, the statement is a public announcement of new legislation and does not involve any internal agency deliberations or decision-making processes. Therefore, it would not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;             ▪ New Criminal Background Checks. An important way to improve the quality of nursing homes is to prevent inadequate personnel from entering the system in the first place. The legislation you will propose would require nursing homes to conduct criminal background checks on all potential personnel.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. The statement provided does not fall under this category as it is a proposed legislation and not an inter-agency or intra-agency communication. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;             ▪ National Abuse Registry. Once inadequate personnel have been identified, they should be kept out of the system. The new legislation will ask Congress to establish a national registry of nursing home employees convicted of abusing residents.	It is possible that the National Abuse Registry could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The reasoning for this is that the creation and maintenance of the registry may involve internal agency deliberations and decision-making processes that are considered privileged. Additionally, the registry may contain sensitive information about individuals, such as their criminal records, which could be protected under privacy exemptions. However, it ultimately depends on the specific details of how the registry is created and maintained, and whether any exemptions apply.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;             ▪ Nutrition and Hydration Therapy. Currently, too few nursing home staff are available to help feed residents. To improve nutrition in nursing homes, you will ask Congress to allow more categories of nursing home employees to perform crucial nutrition and hydration functions.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the information was part of internal deliberations or communications between government officials regarding the proposed policy change, it could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, if the information is already public knowledge or was communicated to external parties, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this information is exempt from FOIA would depend on the specific circumstances surrounding its creation and dissemination.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;                 • Reauthorization of the ursing Home Ombudsman Program. You also will call on Congress to reauthorize the nursing home ombudsman program run by the Administration on Aging, which provides consumers with critical information on poor-quality nursing homes, including records of abuse and neglect.	No, the reauthorization of the nursing home ombudsman program would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications, such as those between an attorney and client or those involving deliberative processes within an agency. The reauthorization of a program and a call to Congress for action does not fall under this exemption.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; New Administrative Actions To Improve the Quality of Nursing Homes. You will announce new administrative actions that HCFA will implement immediately, including:	It is possible that some parts of the announcement may be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, without more information about the specific content of the announcement, it is difficult to determine definitively whether exemption 5 would apply. If the announcement contains internal deliberations or recommendations that are part of the agency's decision-making process, those portions may be exempt from disclosure. However, if the announcement simply describes new policies or initiatives that the agency plans to implement, those portions may not be exempt. Ultimately, the determination of whether exemption 5 applies would depend on the specific content and context of the announcement.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     • Immediate Civil Monetary Penalties in Nursing Homes That Violate Federal Standards. To crack down on inadequate providers, HCFA will direct enforcement authorities to impose civil monetary penalties immediately upon finding a serious or chronic violation. Under current practice, enforcement officials often give nursing homes a second chance to come into compliance, rather than impose immediate sanctions.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The policy decision to impose immediate civil monetary penalties is likely the result of internal agency deliberations and may involve legal advice or other privileged information. As such, it would likely be exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     • Tougher Nursing Home Inspections. Starting today, HCFA will take several steps to strengthen states' inspection of nursing homes, such as:	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided is a public announcement of a policy change and does not involve any privileged or confidential communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Staggering survey times: The report that HCFA is transmitting to Congress finds that nursing home inspeciions are too predictable, allowing inadequate homes to prepare for inspections. Enforcement officials will now stagger survey times and conduct some surveys on weekends and evenings.	The information in this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be part of a decision-making process. It is simply a statement of a new policy or procedure being implemented by HCFA. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Targeting chains with bad records: Federal and State officials will target nursing home chains that have a poor record of compliance with the Federal regulations for additional inspections.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the decision to target specific nursing home chains was made through internal discussions or deliberations within the agency, those communications could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, if the decision was based on publicly available information or data, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this information is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the decision-making process.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Increasing criminal investigations: HCFA also will work with the HHS Office of Inspector General and Department of Justice to refer egregious violations of quality of care standards for criminal investigation and prosecution when appropriate.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The statement in question does not fall under any of these categories and therefore would not be exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     • Stronger Federal Oversight of State Inspections. HCFA will increase its oversight of state surveyors, review and monitor nursing homes with greater consistency, and take new tough actions against those states that are failing to adequately enforce standards. It will:	The statement provided would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. The statement provided does not involve any inter-agency or intra-agency communication and does not contain any deliberative information. It is a statement of policy and action that the agency plans to take, which is not protected under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Terminate Federal nursing home inspection funding to states with continual poor records. The report being released by HCFA finds that some states have cited few or no nursing homes for substandard care. In states where oversight is clearly inadequate, HCFA will terminate state contracts and contract with other entities to conduct Federally-approved inspections.	This statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement in question is a policy decision and does not involve any privileged or confidential communications. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Increase oversigpt of state inspections. HCFA will increase its review of the surveys conducted by the states to ensure thorough oversight, as well as provide additional training and other assistance to state-enforcement officials.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. The statement provided does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be deliberative in nature. It is a statement of a plan or action to increase oversight and provide assistance, which does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Ensure that nursing homes are in compliance with standards before lifting sanctions. HCFA will increase oversight of state enforcement officials to ensure that they will not lift sanctions until after an on-site visit has verified compliance.	The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The statement appears to be a directive from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to its enforcement officials, and as such, could be considered an internal communication that is exempt from disclosure. Additionally, the statement may contain deliberative process privilege, as it reflects the agency's decision-making process in determining how to enforce compliance with nursing home standards.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     • Preventing Bed Sores, Dehydration, and Malnutrition. HCFA will implement new oversight to ensure that nursing homes take actions to prevent bed sores, dehydration, and malnutrition. State surveyors will be required to monitor these activities, and sanction nursing homes with patterns of violations. HCFA also will work with the Administration on Aging, the American Dieticians Association, clinicians, consumers, and nursing homes to develop best practice guidelines to prevent malnutrition and dehydration.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement provided is a policy announcement and does not involve any inter-agency or intra-agency communication. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     • Publishing Survey Results on the Internet. To increase accountability and flag repeat offenders for families and the public, HCFA will, for the first time, post individual nursing home survey results on the Internet. /	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The reasoning behind this is that the survey results may contain internal deliberations or opinions of agency officials that are considered privileged and not subject to disclosure. However, it is also possible that the information could be released under FOIA if it is deemed to be in the public interest and not outweighed by any potential harm to the agency or individuals involved. Ultimately, the decision would depend on the specific circumstances and the interpretation of the exemption by the agency and any courts involved.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     • Implementing New Efforts to Measure and Monitor Nursing Home Quality. In June 1998, HCFA began collecting information on resident care through a national automated data system, known as Minimum Data Sets. This information will be analyzed to identify potential areas of inadequate care in nursing homes and to assess performance in critical areas, such as nutrition, avoidable bed sores, loss of mobility, and use ofrestraints. This assessment will help HCFA and state surveyors to identify nursing homes for immediate on-site inspections and to detect and correct problems earlier.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information described in the passage is not a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor is it privileged or confidential. It is a description of a program or initiative being implemented by HCFA, and as such, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;         III. PARTICIPANTS	Without any specific information about the context or content of the document in question, it is difficult to determine whether the information about participants would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 generally covers privileged communications, such as those between an attorney and client or those that would reveal the agency's decision-making process. If the information about participants falls under one of these categories, it may be protected under exemption 5. However, if the information is simply a list of names or other non-privileged information, it would likely not be protected under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Briefing Participants: Secretary Shalala Bruce Reed Chris Jennings Participants: Secretary Shalala Members of senior citizen organizations	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, more information would be needed to make a definitive determination. If the briefing involved discussions of sensitive policy matters or legal advice, for example, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. On the other hand, if the briefing simply involved routine updates or general information sharing, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the decision would depend on the specific content and context of the briefing.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;         IV. PRESS PLAN Pool Press.	"It is possible that the following could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, without additional context or information about the nature of the ""PRESS PLAN"" and the specific agency or agencies involved, it is difficult to make a definitive determination. If the ""PRESS PLAN"" contains sensitive or confidential information related to agency decision-making or strategy, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;         V. SEQUENCE OF EVENTS     • Secretary Shalala will make remarks and introduce YOU.     • YOU will deliver a statement.     • YOU may answer questions from the pool, and then depart.	No, the given sequence of events would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or contain deliberative process information. The given sequence of events does not involve any such communication or information. It is a simple outline of a public event and does not contain any privileged or deliberative information. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;         VI. REMARKS Remarks Provided by Speechwriting	It is possible that the remarks provided by speechwriting could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. If the remarks were created as part of the deliberative process of developing policy or making decisions, they may be considered pre-decisional and deliberative, and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, if the remarks were simply a record of a completed decision or policy, they would not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether the remarks are exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances surrounding their creation and use.
T0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; October 3, 1997 MEMORANDUM TO THE CHIEF OF STAFF cc: FROM: RE: Sylvia Matthews, John Podesta, Bruce Reed, Gene Sperling, Frank Raines, Rahm Emanuel, John Hilley, Mickey Ibarra, Jack Lew, and Josh Gotbaum Chris Jennings NEW YORK AND THE PROVIDER TAX ISSUE	It is possible that this memorandum could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The fact that it is a memorandum suggests that it may contain internal deliberations or advice, which could be considered privileged. However, without more information about the content of the memorandum and the context in which it was created, it is difficult to make a definitive determination.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; On Monday, we (DPC, 0MB and HHS) will brief you on the status of our Medicaid provider tax enforcement plans for New York and other states who may be out of compliance with current law and regulations.  As you well know, this issue is extremely controversial.  Therefore, it is critically important that we have Administration-wide agreement and understanding on how we will announce our position on outstanding provider taxes and on how we will subsequently negotiate with affected states. This memo provides you with background information to help prepare you for the Monday briefing.	The memo may be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The memo discusses the need for Administration-wide agreement and understanding on a controversial issue, which suggests that it may contain internal deliberations or pre-decisional communications that are protected from disclosure. However, the specific nature of the privileged communication would need to be further evaluated to determine if it meets the requirements for exemption 5.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; BACKGROUND Financing scheme. During the late 1980s, many states established financing schemes that had the effect of increasing their Federal Medicaid funds without using additional state resources. Typically, states would raise funds from health care providers (through provider taxes or ""donations""), then pay back those providers through increased Medicaid payments. Since the Federal government pays at least half of Medicaid payments, the provider taxes or donations would be repaid in large part by Federal matching payments. Using this mechanism, the state was left with a net gain because it only had to repay part of the provider tax or donation it originally received.  This led to an unprecedented drain on the Federal Treasury - the major reason why Federal Medicaid costs more than doubled between 1988 and 1992."	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The information provided in the background does not appear to be inter-agency or intra-agency communications, but rather a description of a financing scheme used by states to increase their Federal Medicaid funds. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The law and regulatory interpretation of the law. Because provider taxes and donations were effectively siphoning off potentially billions of dollars from the Federal Treasury, the Congress limited states' use of these schemes in a bill enacted by President Bush in 1991.  It is important to note that the subsequent regulatory interpretation of these limits -- the very regulations that we are now planning to enforce -- was negotiated with the states and the National Governors' Association in 1993.	"Yes, the statement would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" The statement refers to the regulatory interpretation of the law, which was negotiated between the states and the National Governors' Association. This negotiation process likely involved inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available to the public. Therefore, the statement would be protected under exemption 5."
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; States' continued reliance on impermissible provider taxes and our enforcement record. Despite the new law and the regulations, many states continued to use provider taxes that at least appeared to be out of compliance. To date, these possibly impermissible taxes total an estimated $2 to 4 billion and, in the future, will cost billions more. In response, HCFA issued letters and discussed its concerns about certain taxes with states, but -- for a variety of reasons -- never took any final action (called a ""disallowance""). Unfortunately, this has meant that a number of states have continued using these taxes, believing that HCFA might never enforce the law, or that if they did, they could seek recourse through the White House or the Congress. (In fact, since we do not have a good track record on enforcement, budget examiners at CBO and in the Administration have already written off Federal revenue raised through these provider taxes; this is important to know since it means we could waive past ""abuses"" retrospectively and it might not be scored as a cost.)"	This statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement does not appear to contain any privileged information or communications. It is a factual description of HCFA's enforcement record and concerns about states' use of provider taxes.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The New York provision in the balanced budget. To ensure that New York would never be vulnerable to Medicaid provider tax enforcement actions, Senator Moynihan and Senator D' Amato successfully added a provision to the Balanced Budget Act to exempt all of its provider taxes (it has dozens), both retrospectively and prospectively, from disallowances. Both in writing and orally we repeatedly objected to this provision. Moreover, we provided alternative statutory language that would have addressed about two-thirds (over $ I billion worth) of the problem. As you know, however, the Senators (through their staff) rejected our offer and insisted on their original provisions.	This statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be pre-decisional or deliberative. It is a statement about a provision in a law that has already been passed, and it does not involve any internal agency discussions or decision-making processes.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Line-item veto and New York's reaction. In announcing the line-item veto on August 11, we raised concerns about the cost and ramifications of singling out as permissible one state's provider taxes. Although our actions were generally viewed as responsible and defensible by those who know the program and/or who are budget experts, the same clearly cannot be said of New York's political establishment. The Governor's office, the New York Congressional delegation, the Mayor, providers and unions reacted strongly and negatively to the veto.  Among a host of complaints, they charged that they were singled out and were never made aware that this provision could be subject to the line item veto. Most recently they have criticized us for our . delay in getting back to them and our willingness to support fixes for the other two vetoed provisions without addressing their problem.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This passage does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be part of a decision-making process. It is a public statement about a controversial decision and the reaction to it.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Review of provider taxes in New York and other states. In August, we began a review of the options to address provider taxes in New York and other states. At the time, we well knew that this action would force us to finally attempt to move to enforce laws against provider taxes in all 36 states that may be out of compliance. We also knew that we had to take this position to support our justification for the line-item veto that no individual state be singled out for special treatment.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The passage appears to describe internal deliberations and decision-making processes related to enforcing laws against provider taxes in multiple states, which could be considered privileged information. Additionally, the passage suggests that the agency was considering legal justifications for its actions, which could also be considered privileged.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Wednesday's actions. We believe that our discussion with New York next Wednesday about their provider tax status necessitates that we concurrently release similar information to every other potentially affected state. Three types of actions resulting from this comprehensive review will be announced. First, HCFA will clarify its interpretation of the law and correct the regulation affecting one of the largest New York provider taxes. These policy  clarifications will provide relief to JO states, the largest amount (over $1 billion) going to New York. •	"Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language used in the passage suggests that there is an ongoing discussion and review process within HCFA (an agency), and that the information being discussed is sensitive and potentially subject to policy changes. Additionally, the passage mentions ""policy clarifications"" that will provide relief to certain states, which suggests that there may be legal or regulatory issues at play that could be subject to exemption 5 protection."
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Second, HCFA will issue letters to 9 other states notifying them that one or several of their taxes may be impermissible. Two more states, New York and Louisiana, will also receive this news, but it will be in a letter that also provides some good news about other provider taxes in their states. HCFA will immediately contact these states to begin discussions. The letters do not contain final decisions nor are they legally binding; however, they tell these states that, without further information, HCFA could conduct an audit.	Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The letters from HCFA to the states regarding potentially impermissible taxes and the possibility of an audit could be considered pre-decisional and deliberative, as they are not final decisions and are part of the agency's internal decision-making process. Additionally, the letters may contain legal advice or opinions, which would also be protected under exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Third, HCFA will ask another 17 states for more information on one or more of their provider taxes, to assess if they are permissible. (Nine other states who are in one of the top two categories will get similar requests.) For these states, we simply do not have sufficient information to determine the legality of at least some of their taxes.  As we discuss this issue with these states, however, we will also make certain they are aware that they may be eligible for waivers that make their taxes permissible and/or that the provision of additional information may well clarify the legality of their taxes. [NOTE: All states affected are listed in the attached document; dollar amounts are not listed because we will not know them until/unless the states are audited.]	Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language used in the passage suggests that HCFA is in the process of assessing the legality of certain provider taxes and discussing the issue with affected states. This suggests that the information is part of an ongoing internal deliberation process and may be considered privileged. Additionally, the fact that dollar amounts are not listed suggests that the information may be considered confidential financial information.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Discussions and negotiations. The follow up to these letters will be, we hope, immediate discussions between HCFA and the states. Our primary goal is to protect the Federal Treasury prospectively. We may have to trade getting only a fraction of the retrospective disallowed taxes in return for expeditious agreements to prevent future use of impermissible taxes. However, the Department of Justice, which must approve all settlements, has not yet decided how it will evaluate these settlements. This information is crucial to HCFA's ability to negotiate with states in good faith.	Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The discussion of negotiations and potential settlements with the Department of Justice suggests that this information is part of a deliberative process aimed at reaching a decision or policy, and therefore falls under the exemption. Additionally, the mention of protecting the Federal Treasury suggests that this information may also be protected under exemption 4, which covers confidential business information.
D1			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Implications. Very few of the states who receive notices will be pleased. For example, although HCFA is relieving approximately two-thirds of New York's past impermissible tax claims (worth over $1 billion), there is still at least $500 million in taxes that HCFA probably cannot consider legal. The New York delegation has already put us on notice that nothing less than a ""hold harmless"" solution is acceptable. They define this as meaning that they want us to waive all current taxes both retrospectively and prospectively; in other words, they want the provisions we line-item vetoed."	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language used in the passage suggests that it is discussing internal agency deliberations and negotiations with state officials, which would likely be considered privileged.

They are: Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, and Tennessee. Governor Carnahan, who met with Jack Lew recently to discuss Medicaid issues, made it clear that he considers his taxes legal and will go to court if necessary. There is no question that Missouri has the largest problem -  they could owe nearly $1 billion.	"Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of a meeting between Governor Carnahan and Jack Lew, as well as the statement that Carnahan ""made it clear"" he considers his taxes legal and will go to court if necessary, suggests that this information was part of a privileged communication between the governor's office and the federal government. Additionally, the mention of potential legal action and the amount of money at stake could suggest that this information is part of ongoing legal proceedings, which would also be exempt under FOIA."
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Another complication is that we anticipate that many of these states will appeal to you or the President to over-ride these preliminary or subsequent decisions. Since this is an enforcement action, we all need to be extremely careful about intervening. We must ensure that you and others who might be talking with Governors are well briefed on the issues, arguments and process.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The statement appears to be discussing legal strategy and advice related to an enforcement action, which would likely fall under the attorney-client privilege or the deliberative process privilege. Additionally, the statement suggests that the information is being shared in order to ensure that decision-makers are well-informed, which could be seen as part of the agency's decision-making process and therefore protected under the deliberative process privilege.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Finally, some states will inevitably seek legislative solutions, like New York's balanced budget provision. While we probably should not encourage this action (for the same reasons that we vetoed the New York provision), we also should not foreclose the possibility that some type of comprehensive legislative clarification could be helpful as we aim to end the practice of illegitimately using provider taxes.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it involve any decision-making process.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Roll-out strategy. Obviously, our rationale and process for explaining our enforcement actions is crucial. DPC/NEC and OMB are working with HHS and HCFA to ensure that we have an effective roll-out. This will include how we provide information to the Congress, the states, interested providers and unions, experts who will validate our enforcement action and influence elite media coverage, and -- of course -- a carefully orchestrated New York strategy.	Yes, the roll-out strategy would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The strategy involves internal discussions and planning between multiple agencies, including DPC/NEC, OMB, HHS, and HCFA, and is likely considered privileged information that is exempt from disclosure. Additionally, the strategy involves sensitive information about how the agency plans to communicate with Congress, states, providers, unions, and the media, which could harm the agency's ability to effectively enforce its actions if disclosed.

Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be an internal communication discussing the roll-out of a plan or policy, and the language suggests that it is intended for a limited audience within the agency. As such, it would likely be considered a privileged communication that is exempt from disclosure under FOIA.

This information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. While the letter from the NGA requesting a meeting with the POTUS may be considered an internal communication, the content of the letter and the conversations with Ray and the Democrats do not appear to involve any legal advice or deliberative process that would qualify for exemption 5 protection.

While it  matters that the federal government will require proper immunization in child care centers it  funds, the truth is that, according to CDC, the regulation won't cause many new children to be immunized (given the requirements that states already have in place). I worry a bit that the people talking to the press about the  immunization rates (e.g., state health officers)  will poo poo our initiative.  I have our friend Bill Corr looking into this more carefully, so I'm not convinced yet, but when he gets back to Chris, you two may want to talk about it. Sorry for rambling, but I think you get the idea.	This statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be an internal discussion among government officials about a potential policy change, and it includes references to a specific individual (Bill Corr) who is conducting further research on the issue. This suggests that the discussion is part of an ongoing deliberative process within the agency, which is typically protected from disclosure under exemption 5.

I'm still stuck  on the problem that we shouldn't  get into the business  of mandating coverage one body part at a time, but I do agree that it is a bit different since this bill would only put it on the same footing as other prescription drugs.

The Genome Action Plan, which consists of nearly one hundred groups -- including AARP, National Organization of Rare Disorders, National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, Parkinson's Disease Foundation, and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and the March of Dimes -- is willing to design an event with us in order to highlight our report and support legislation on genetic discrimination. They are proposing an event that would take place at the National Academy of Sciences, which would include remarks by a few of their members and a couple of victims of genetic discrimination and the President or Vice President. NAS holds about 600 people. If we want a specific event for this, they are willing to design it as a legislative conference -- which would be appropriate since they too are about ready to announce their support of the Slaughter legislation.	This would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications. It is a discussion of a potential event with external groups and does not involve any internal government deliberations or decision-making processes.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Event in conjunction with announcement on new gene discovery. Apparently, there is a new gene discovery on a well-known late adulthood disease that is potentially being announced in the next month in Science magazine. Science has not decided when they will publish this gene, although there is fairly good chance they will publish it in late June or early July:  They will be able to notify us between two and three weeks before publication. When they do publish, the Human Genome Institute plans to do a press conference on the discovery. This event -- could highlight the discovery and then emphasize that as we make these new breakthroughs on genetics, we should enact legislation to ensure that this genetic information is not used to discriminate against people. (Even if we do not want to use this to highlight the genetic screening legislation, we may want to consider some possible POTUS involvement). This event is not necessarily mutually exclusive from the event with the Genome Action Plan.	It is possible that this event could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language used in the description suggests that there may be internal discussions or deliberations about how to handle the announcement of the new gene discovery and how to frame it in a way that supports certain policy goals. However, without more information about the specific content of the communications, it is difficult to say for certain whether exemption 5 would apply.

The memorandum appears to be a communication between high-level officials within the government, discussing strategy for a sensitive issue (the Southwest border). As such, it is likely that the memorandum contains privileged information that is exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Barry Mccaffrey has sent you the attached memorandum regarding his proposal to organize drug control efforts along the Southwest border.    Barry has narrowed his original concept to focus specifically on controlling illegal narcotics that cross the border, rather than casting a wider net covering a broader range of border activities.    He calls for greater coordination among Customs, the Border Patrol and other relevant agencies to address the flow of drugs and urges you designate a single federal official responsible for all counterdrug efforts along the border. He also recommends we develop and deploy advanced technologies to increase detection rates of drug contraband while facilitating legitimate traffic.    Barry has gone ahead and announced that he plans to forward these proposals to you in the coming weeks.	It is possible that this memorandum could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The memorandum appears to contain advice and recommendations from Barry McCaffrey, who is a government official, to another government official. This type of communication may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5. However, the specific circumstances of the communication and the agency's justification for withholding it would need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Justice and Treasury, however, are not yet on board, and are very unhappy with Barry's method of advancement.   Barry will be meeting with Janet Reno and Bob Rubin before October 1 to try to bridge the gap.  Barry has agreed to seek Sandy's help in coordinating a decision package to you, following his meeting with Reno and Rubin, addressing all ·unresolved issues and reflecting all interested agency viewpoints.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. The statement contains internal discussions and disagreements between different agencies and individuals, as well as plans for future meetings and coordination efforts.

The drug-control challenges we face along the Southwest Border, though severe, are not insurmountable. About 60 percent of the cocaine entering the U.S. does so across this border, yet seizures in the border region are declining. Total 1998 cocaine seizures are projected to be less than half of the annual average seized between 1991 and 1996 and account for just a fifth of the cocaine crossing the border. Heroin seizures have declined by about a third since 1996. Over the past several years, the general trend has been one of fewer seizures of all drugs except marijuana. Our visits last month to San Diego and El Paso reinforced our belief that immediate action must be taken to address the following issues:	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     III. The Response. For the last three years, the many federal agencies involved in law enforcement, commerce and transportation along our border have been engaged in a process to determine how we can best fulfill these anti-drug imperatives. The Attorney General and the Secretaries of State, Treasury, Commerce, Defense, and Transportation, and the leadership of the DEA, the Border Patrol, Customs, and the INS have been integral to this effort.  Our common  response is to create a Southwest Border Counter-Drug White Paper for approval by the President during the fall of 1998.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

While we talked to the states in advance we did not try to bring them to the announcement.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     I. Summary Inadequate dredging of the channels and berthing  areas serving  the Port of  New  York  and New Jersey, and the lack of leadership to solve the problem, have caused several major port companies to announce that they may  relocate their hub operations to Halifax,  Nova Scotia, or to other U.S. ports. Company decisions are expected in June or July. Fearful of job losses to Canada, the longshoremen have focused pressure to resolve dredging  issues on  Governors Pataki and Whitman. Concurrently, concern about disposal of contaminated dredged  material off New Jersey's coast has prompted Governor Whitman to criticize the  Administration's disposal policies as environmentally unsound. Her message has been lauded and reinforced by environmental groups and New Jersey shore communities, but it has further impeded needed dredging.	"It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of ""lack of leadership"" and criticism of the Administration's disposal policies suggest that there may be internal deliberations or communications within government agencies that are being referenced. However, without more specific information about the source and context of this summary, it is difficult to make a definitive determination."
D1			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The primary obstacle to full-scale dredging is the lack of acceptable disposal alternatives. Disposal alternatives are primarily a state responsibility, but  require federal  action. On  May 24, in an agreement with labor leaders, Governor Whitman promised that limited dredging of berthing areas would begin in June. We understand  that Governor  Whitman  is planning  a press conference on June 6 to announce the start of dredging, but port companies and unions remain highly skeptical. A visible, credible signal is therefore still needed to persuade the unions, port companies, and state governments that the  Administration  is  ready  to  get dredging moving as soon  as the states do their  part. We also  must  disarm  possible criticism on the environmental issues. Thus, the initiative  proposed  here is in  large  measure preemptive: we are increasing pressure on Whitman and Pataki to make tough decisions about local disposal options while protecting the President from  blame  either  for  imminent  job losses or for potential harm to the oceans. At  the same  time,  we  must  take care  not  to suggest too much Federal ""ownership"" of a problem that  inherently  must stay  on  the governors' doorsteps. The governors, not the Administration, must resolve politically divisive decisions about local disposal sites, and must negotiate between  themselves  the  relative benefits New York and New Jersey receive from Port Authority monies earmarked for dredging."	The passage may be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. The passage appears to be discussing internal deliberations and strategy regarding the issue of dredging and disposal alternatives, including how to pressure state governors to make tough decisions while avoiding blame for job losses or environmental harm. The passage also acknowledges the need to avoid suggesting too much federal involvement in a state responsibility. However, it is ultimately up to a court to determine if the passage meets the criteria for exemption 5 protection.

A vocal segment  of  the environmental community, possibly joined by Representative Pallone, is likely to be critical or unsupportive at best, although we are hoping that the environmental elements of the initiative will win over Pallone and a few of  the  more  mainstream  environmental  groups. Criticism also is possible from Representative Nadler, who has been pushing an ambitious (and probably impracticable) plan to require more dredging (and thus generate more development) for long-idle wharves in Brooklyn.	This statement is unlikely to be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be a factual assessment of political and environmental support for an initiative, rather than a privileged communication between government officials.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Delegations from states that compete with New York may raise questions of favoritism. In particular Norfolk, Virginia stands to gain from New York's losses, and Baltimore has ----- -------- competitive disadvantages of its own. To a lesser degree, Connecticut is concerned that any action we take in New York has the potential to raise the visibility of similar challenges in Connecticut ports. Several elements in the initiative (such  as cost-sharing  upland  disposal) will benefit these other ports as well as New York and New Jersey, however, so we currently expect affirmative support for the initiative from these other ports as well as national port organizations.	This statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. This statement does not appear to be a communication between government agencies or officials, nor does it involve the deliberation of a specific decision or policy.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     II. Timing House members feel strongly that an announcement needs to occur  before  the June 11 markup of the water resources development authorization bill.

We may then adjust the elements of the initiative, to ensure strong support from those groups.	Yes, this could potentially be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language suggests that there may be internal deliberations and discussions among government officials about the timing and content of an announcement, which could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances and whether the information meets the criteria for exemption 5.

Recommendation	It is not possible to determine whether the following would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 without additional context. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The determination of whether a document falls under this exemption depends on whether it is predecisional and deliberative in nature. Without knowing the content and context of the recommendation, it is impossible to determine whether it would be protected under exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; We recommend that you approve a five-point plan for the Port that  would  be announced before House markup of the water resources development  authorization  bill. The five points of the plan would be as follows, and are detailed in the attachment:	It is possible that the recommendation and the five-point plan could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the recommendation and plan were developed as part of an internal deliberative process, such as a discussion among agency officials about potential policy options, they may be considered pre-decisional and deliberative, and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, if the recommendation and plan were already finalized and implemented, or if they were created for the purpose of informing the public or Congress, they would not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether the recommendation and plan are exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances of their creation and use.

We will seek alternatives to ocean and estuary dumping.     5. We will help prepare the port for the 21st century	It is possible that these statements could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, without additional context it is difficult to determine whether these statements were made in the context of privileged communications such as attorney-client discussions or deliberative processes. If they were simply statements made in public documents or communications, they would not be protected under exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; In developing this recommendation we have consulted closely with the Departments of Transportation and the Army and with the Environmental Protection Agency. The Secretaries concur with this recommendation, with the exception  that EPA  reserves its judgment  on  two of the detailed elements pending the outcome of our consultations with environmental interests, and one element is undergoing separate legal and policy review. All agree that whether  this  announcement  should  be  made  by  the  President  or  by  the  Secretaries   will  depend on the outcome of the consultation process.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement indicates that the agencies consulted with each other and with outside groups, and that they are still in the process of making a decision. The fact that the EPA is reserving judgment on some elements and that one element is undergoing legal and policy review suggests that there may be sensitive or confidential information involved. Additionally, the statement indicates that the decision on whether to make an announcement will depend on the outcome of the consultation process, which suggests that there may be ongoing discussions or negotiations that could be disrupted by disclosure.

Decision         Approve         Disapprove       Let's Discuss •	It is difficult to determine whether the given information would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 without additional context. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. ; ; If the given information pertains to an inter-agency or intra-agency decision-making process and contains privileged or confidential communications, it may be protected under exemption 5. However, if the information is simply a list of options for a decision without any privileged or confidential communications, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
T0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; June 17, 1996 MEMORANDUM FOR HAROLD ICKES THROUGH: Jennifer M. O'Connor FROM:   Bradley M. Campbell Diane Regas SUBJECT:    New York-New Jersey Harbor Dredging - Status	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The memorandum appears to be an internal communication between government officials discussing the status of a dredging project, which could contain sensitive or confidential information related to the decision-making process. As such, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; We have discussed the draft ""Healthy Port Initiative"" with labor unions; port operators and shipping interests; moderate environmentalists; Representatives Menendez, Pallone, and Torricelli; and Senator Lautenberg's  staff.  Below  is a summary  of the  remaining  issues and our recommended next steps. We have consulted with EPA and OMB in making our recommendation, and they agree."	"Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of consultations with EPA and OMB suggests that the information is part of an internal deliberative process, and therefore exempt from disclosure.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; While there is consensus on most elements of the initiative, there remains  a  sharp  divide between Rep. Menendez Goined by the ports and the unions), and Congressmen Pallone and Torricelli Goined by environmental  groups  and  possibly  Governor  Whitman)  over  two central issues:	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing internal deliberations and disagreements among members of Congress and other stakeholders, which would likely be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under this exemption.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     • The Mud Dump Site (MDS): A dredge  material  disposal  site offshore  but  near Pallone's district. Federal law and policy now allows  disposal  of  category  I  and category 2 dredge material  at  this site.  (Category  I  is clean;  category  2 passes  tests but has some contamination; category 3 is not suitable for disposal in the ocean.) Governor Whitman has pledged not  to  put category  2 in  the  ocean,  and  that  pledge has been strongly endorsed by environmental groups and  shore  newspapers,  but there  are very few alternatives for category 2 disposal in the short  term.  Our  initiative proposed a decision by January 31, 1997 concerning the phase out of the Mud Dump Site, with the consideration of the alternatives for disposal.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. Specifically, if there were internal discussions or deliberations within the government about the Mud Dump Site and its disposal practices, those communications could be considered privileged and exempt from FOIA requests. However, if the information is simply a description of the site and its current practices, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, it would depend on the specific content and context of the information in question.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     • The EPA testing rule. This is a proposed rule revising  the regulations  governing how and when to test for contamination  in dredge material.    A New Jersey federal court opinion argues that EPA's technical manuals conflict with its underlying regulation -- rendering permits legally vulnerable. Environmentalists have derided EPA's rule as a ""rollback""  of ocean protection. Unions and port operators want the rule finalized as soon as possible, believing the rule change essential if permits to dispose material at the MDS are to survive court challenges. Our initiative proposed EPA action on the rule by August 1, I 996."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The proposed rule and the court opinion may contain internal agency deliberations and discussions that are protected from disclosure. However, it would depend on the specific content of the documents and whether they meet the criteria for exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Positions	No, positions would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications, such as those between an attorney and client or those that would reveal the agency's decision-making process. Positions do not fall under this category and are not considered privileged information.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     • Menendez: Wants continued use of the MD.S  for both category  I  and  2 material,  and continued ocean disposal of category 2 generally.  Wants  EPA  to finalize  its rule in August, to provide certainty to permit applicants.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of EPA rulemaking and permit applications suggests that this information may be part of internal agency deliberations or communications, which could be considered privileged. However, without more context it is difficult to determine definitively whether exemption 5 would apply.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     • Pallone-Torricelli:   Want closure of MDS after an additional 300,000 cubic yards of category 2, or alternatively after category 2 capacity needs  have  been  met  through 1997.   Want  EPA  to postpone  its rule indefinitely.    In offering these proposals, Torricelli and Pallone are negotiating, in part, on behalf of the environmental groups whose support they  need  in  the  corning  elections.  (Representative  Zimmer, Torriceili's opponent in  the current  Senate  race,  reportedly  has  prepared advertisements castigating Torricelli for supporting ocean dumping.)	The information provided would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement describes negotiations between representatives and environmental groups, which could be considered privileged communications related to the agency's decision-making process. Additionally, the fact that the negotiations are related to an upcoming election suggests that the information may be sensitive and subject to exemption.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Recommendation	"It depends on the context and content of the recommendation. FOIA exemption 5 protects ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" This exemption is often used to protect pre-decisional and deliberative communications within an agency.; ; If the recommendation is a pre-decisional communication between agency officials discussing policy options or potential courses of action, it may be protected under exemption 5. However, if the recommendation is a final decision or action taken by the agency, it would not be protected under exemption 5.; ; Additionally, if the recommendation contains information that is otherwise protected by other FOIA exemptions, such as personal privacy or national security, those exemptions would also apply.; ; Overall, the determination of whether a recommendation is protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific circumstances and content of the communication."
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; We recommend that the Administration make a counter-proposal to Pallone and  Torricelli, with the following elements:	It is possible that this recommendation could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the recommendation was made as part of an internal deliberative process, such as a discussion among government officials about how to respond to a legislative proposal, it could be considered pre-decisional and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, if the recommendation was already implemented or adopted as official policy, it would not be protected by exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this recommendation is exempt from FOIA would depend on the specific context in which it was made and the purpose for which it is being requested.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     • We would immediately begin  administrative  action  to close  the MDS  to category  2 at the end I997. This action would require a public proposal (this summer), a comment period, and a final  decision  (early  I997).  We  would  make  the  proposal and indicate our intention to close the  site,  but  would  not  pre-judge  the  final outcome of this process.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing internal agency deliberations and decision-making processes, which are typically considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under this exemption. Additionally, the statement suggests that the agency is considering a public proposal and comment period, which would further support the argument that this is an internal communication related to agency decision-making.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     • We would insist that the MDS be available as necessary until the end of 1997 for disposal of category 1 and 2 material. This  may  require  an  increase  in elevation  at the site.	The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be a recommendation or proposal made within an agency regarding the disposal of hazardous material, and as such, could be considered a pre-decisional communication that is protected from disclosure. Additionally, the statement may contain deliberative process privilege, as it reflects the agency's internal discussions and considerations regarding the disposal of hazardous material.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     • We would agree to delay the EPA rule until  all of the issues  have  been  discussed with environmentalists and other stakeholders, including a process to  examine scientific issues related to the rule. We anticipate  that  this  process  will  take  six to ten months.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing internal agency deliberations and decision-making processes, including discussions with external stakeholders. As such, it could be considered part of the agency's pre-decisional deliberations and therefore exempt from disclosure under exemption 5. Additionally, the statement suggests that the agency is considering scientific issues related to the rule, which could also be considered part of the agency's decision-making process and therefore exempt from disclosure.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     • We would require, as a condition of these  commitments,  that  key  environmental groups agree to not challenge permits to dispose of category I and 2 material  at  the MDS (using the existing testing rule) until the end of I997.	"Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. Specifically, this statement appears to be a negotiation or discussion between parties regarding a potential agreement or commitment, which could be considered pre-decisional and deliberative. Additionally, the mention of ""key environmental groups"" suggests that this may be a sensitive or confidential matter that the agency would not want to disclose publicly."
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Pros: This proposal is very close to that outlined by Pallone and Torricelli,  except  that we would use an appropriate administrative process  to  decide  on  closure  of  the  MDS  rather than announcing closure by fiat, and we  would  reject  the strict  volume  limitation  they propose in the interim. We would expect  that this will  disarm  environmental  criticism  and help move short-term dredging, but we would  want  to  elicit  an  understanding  with  New York and New Jersey that they will not be criticize short-term use of the MDS.	This statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This statement does not appear to be a privileged communication, but rather a discussion of a proposed administrative process and potential environmental concerns.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Cons: It will be difficult to convince  Representative  Menendez  that  this  approach  makes sense. Our position will be that  this  approach  will  accomplish  what  he  needs  by  ensuring that dredging can go on for the next year, while allowing  continued  use of the  MDS  for the very short term: In addition it will allow the EPA rule issues to  be  resolved  in  a  less contentious climate, after  further  work  with  affected  interests,  thereby  reducing  the likelihood  of  litigation  over  the rule itself.    We will need to work  closely  with  Menendez and his staff to help them understand the merits of delaying the rule, and enlist their help in persuading the unions and port companies that this  is the right course.  We  propose  to have those discussions in	particular with Menendez and his staff, and to keep them confidential.; ; Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language suggests that the communication is between individuals within an agency and is intended to be kept confidential. Additionally, the communication involves strategy and persuasion, which could be considered privileged information.
