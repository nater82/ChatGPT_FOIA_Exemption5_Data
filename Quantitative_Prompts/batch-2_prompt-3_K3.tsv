The record would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. However, this record appears to be a communication between individuals outside of the government (Mickey Ibarra and Elena Kagan) and does not appear to be pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. It is a request for information about a draft proposal for a conference and does not involve any decision-making or policy formulation. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.

The Attorney General will draft and transmit to the Congress legislation to give states the flexibility to use their federal prison construction and substance abuse treatment funds for the full range of drug testing, sanctions, and treatment for offenders under criminal justice supervision. This will allow states to tap into the nearly $8 billion in prison funds authorized by the 1994 Crime Law (about $2 billion of which already have been appropriated to date).

However, the content of the record appears to be a directive calling on the Attorney General to develop legislation related to federal prison construction and treatment funds. This type of directive could potentially be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The content of the directive suggests that it may be an internal communication between government officials, which could qualify for exemption 5 protection.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; January 16, 1997 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT FROM: RE: Bruce Reed Elena Kagan DPC Weekly Report; ; Immigration   --  Skills of Immigrants: The attached U.S. News article discusses the issue of whether we should change our legal immigration system to strengthen  preferences for skilled and well-educated prospective  immigrants  over those that are poorly educated  and unskilled.   The current immigration system is set up to favor keeping families intact. Thus, the vast number of legal immigrants are brought to this country through family-based visas, which do  not take into account education or skill level. The article cites a Rand  study proposal  to create a point system of immigration which continues to  give  weight  to  immediate  family  reunification but  would  also give points  for education, language  skills, and work experience. The final report of the Commission on Immigration Reform also recommends a shift  in priority toward  higher skilled immigrants.    Instead creating a point system, the Commission recommends revising skill-based admissions (approximately 100,000 visas) to favor highly-skilled and educated immigrants and eliminating altogether the category of unskilled workers. Though we think that these ideas are well worth exploring, it is unlikely that Congress will want to consider an overhaul of legal immigration this year. Efforts to reduce legal immigration levels were defeated during consideration of the 1996 illegal immigration law.

As you will recall, we did forgo proposing a minimum wage increase when we proposed the Health Security Act because we did not want to load up the costs to employers. The idea of having a defined minimum employer contribution certainly has some merit as it would make a significant contribution to decreasing the number of uninsured.    Having said that, there are a number of political and policy issues that have to be seriously considered prior to pursuing such a proposal.

We have asked HI-IS to review the extent to which this is occurring. However, it is important to note that many independent policy experts believe that payments to HMOs still are, on average, excessive given the fact that they continue to attract disproportionately healthy populations.  They believe that any movement towards reducing 2 benefits are more attributable to HMO ' s desire for adequate profit margins for their investors rather than adjustments in reimbursement issue. In fact, one corporate executive just informed us that Medicare continues to be their number one most profitable player. Having said that, the fact that the BBA is starting to reduce Medicare reimbursements to HMOs will clearly contribute to lower revenues for these health plans. It is important to note that the added benefits in Medicare HMO plans do help encourage beneficiaries to participate in these plans. The outstanding question is whether or not we want to allow payment rates to exceed what is necessary so as to ensure that these additional benefits are in place. Regardless , any move in this direction would be premature until we have better information about the extent to which HMOs are reducing benefits and the reasons behind such a trend. 3	This document may be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch.

The fact that the communication is labeled as a ""Presidential"" record and includes individuals from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Office of the President (EOP) suggests that it may contain privileged advice or recommendations that are protected from disclosure under exemption 5. Additionally, the fact that the communication includes a draft summary of an OMB staff proposal further supports the argument that it is a privileged communication."

I had discussed this some with Mike Cohen earlier, and I had the benefit of attending one meeting with Mike and ED'S Tirozzi  and Johnson.    Attached is a two-page draft summary of the OMB staff proposal. It would: reinforce and support current programs, like Title I, by mainly providing sizable money awards for demonstrated progress in raising student achievement, not just providing more money for more plans for the same things schools are supposed to be doing with Goals and title I and IDEA, etc.;; ; --=----------------- ATTACHMENT l ==================== ATT CREATION TIME/DATE: 0 00:00:00.00	It is possible that this record could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The record appears to be a communication between government officials discussing a proposed alternative approach to addressing educational achievement in high poverty areas. The fact that it is a draft proposal and includes discussion of internal agency deliberations could suggest that it is part of the agency's decision-making process and therefore privileged. However, a more detailed analysis would be necessary to determine whether the specific content of the record meets the requirements for exemption 5 protection.

There are several objectives to this meeting: a) reduce the criticism that the President's Race Initiative is a monologue and is not including people who may disagree with some or all of the President' s vision regarding race; b) obtain constructive suggestions, if any, from the conservative perspective on how best to address the continuing effects of racism, discrimination and lack of equal opportunity for all Americans; and c) show that even within the conservative wing there are differences of opinion as to how best to address continuing problems of discrimination.	This document may be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The memorandum appears to be an internal communication between White House staff members discussing strategy for outreach to conservatives and Republicans. The content of the communication may be considered privileged because it involves the development of policy and strategy, and the disclosure of this information could harm the decision-making process of the executive branch. However, it is ultimately up to a court to determine whether this document is exempt from disclosure under FOIA.

To help working families afford child care, the proposal: (1) increases funding for federal child care subsidies through the Child Care and Development Block Grant; and (2) changes the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit by raising the percentage of child care expenses  for which a  taxpayer may take a credit and by increasing the income levels of taxpayers who may  claim it. Currently, the credit rate is phased down from 30% for taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $10,000 or less to 20% for taxpayers with AGI above $28,000.  We are considering a series of options, including raising the credit rate from 50% for taxpayers with AGI of $30,000 to 20% for those with AGI above $59,000.)  We are also considering targeted investments to improve  the safety and quality of care.    First, the proposal adds funding to the scholarship program for child care providers, which you announced at the child care conference and  which has  received strong support. Second, it includes a new program that will ensure safety and healthy early learning and development for children in the critical first years. Third, the proposal provides resources for states to improve their enforcement of health and safety standards, and fourth, it funds parent education, research and technology. Finally, the proposal makes safe, constructive activities for youth during after-school hours more available by creating a new program for school age children and by coordinating existing programs.

I do  not  want  to sit on this beyond Monday as the main coalition of interest groups -- the Task Force on Radiation and Human Rights -- has asked us to get it out the door before their meeting April 1 (per a letter Diane brought to my attention Friday). DOE and my preference is to release the  report, however we can, this week. Pena and key Asst. Secretary are available Friday and MAY be available Thursday. Barry Toiv is now working to get closure in the press office. If this comes  up again, please let people know we need to get it out the door. We just need 2 days notice to  get to advisory committee members, certain reporters, and key Hill people if we want to get any decent press and not offend anyone. Since 7 agencies are involved, outreach can't be done at very last minute. Thanks for your help.	This message would likely not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. While the message is a communication between two officials within the Executive Office of the President, it does not appear to contain any legal advice, attorney-client communications, or other privileged information. Rather, it is a discussion of the timing and logistics of releasing a report to the public, and includes references to outreach efforts and the preferences of various officials. As such, it would likely be considered a routine administrative communication that is subject to disclosure under FOIA.

He asked ACHRE to uncover the truth, recommend ways to right past wrongs, and suggest ways to make sure the government will not repeat past mistakes.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. The email does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government.

ACHRE found that the-government had conducted several thousand human radiation experiments from 1945 to 1975 and that the majority advanced biomedical research. The Committee found, however, that some were conducted unethically. For example, scientists injected plutonium into 18 patients without their knowledge, and researchers conducted experiments on indigent patients and children.

The administration also said it has settled the last of a number of claims, totalling $6.5 million, from families of civilians who were injected with plutonium or uranium as part of secret experiments in the 1940s. The actions are• • designed to increase public trust ... and make our government accountable to the American people,"" said Energy Secretary Federico Pena, whose department has spearheaded the public review of past radiation experiments. Pena said the administration also will ask Congress to expand a program that provides compensation to uranium miners who were exposed to radiation as part of the government nuclear weapons program. He said up to 600 additional miners would be compensated at a cost of about $ 50 million. The plans for giving greater protection to research participants were prompted by recommendations more than a year ago by a presidential commission that investigated the government's use of humans in radiation research during the Cold War years. The advisory panel warned that past excesses might be repeated unless there are new safeguards. The White House said today that Clinton had signed a memorandum ,; strengthening the rights and protections afforded individuals who agree to be subjects of secret, government-supported research. The White House said a review by an interagency task force uncovered no government-supported classified human research at this time. But officials acknowledged that formal accounting for such research needs to be improved. Meanwhile, the White House said it had settled claims with four additional families of 1B individuals who were given plutonium injections as part of 1940s experiments. One victim has not been located and the family of another does not want compensation, said Tara O'Toole, DOE's assistant secretary for environment, safety and health. Associate  Attorney  General  John Dwyer  said the 16 claims        12 of which  totalling  $4.B million  were  made  public last November  total $6.5 million. The government has said it is prepared to provide compensation to the families of 52 other individuals who the advisory commission said were believed to be subjected to improper radiation experiments. The identity of those 52 are not known, and so far no families have come forward, according to the White House. Under the new presidential directive on human research, agencies must develop new rules that clearly require scientists to obtain informed consent from all potential subjects of secret experiments. Currently, such consent may be waived under some circumstances. The president also ordered that any research subject be told the identity of the sponsoring agency and whether the experimentation is classified. The new rules also would require the head of the agency to approve such research and develop a more independent review process than currently provided. Also in response to the October 1995 findings by the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, the president said he will: Ask Congress to broaden a 1990 law that allows compensation to underground uranium miners who became ill because of exposure to radiation. Under current law, hundreds of miners are ineligible for compensation. Will propose legislation to make veterans' health care benefits available to airmen and sailors who were subjects of radioactive nasal treatments more than 50 years ago. The treatments were to prevent broken eardrums during flight or in submarines. Will seek broader epidemiological studies to determine the long-term health impact of nuclear bomb testing during the Cold War to military personnel and civilian populations near the test areas.

When I became the President, I realized we had great new economic challenges, we had profound social problems, that a lot of these things had to be done by an energized American citizenry, but that our national government_had   role ·to play in moving our country through this period of transition.  And in order to do it, we needed to increase the capacity of the government to do it through political reform, but we also needed, as much as anything else, to increase the confidence of the American people that, at the very least, they could trust the United States government to tell the truth and to do the right things.

That's when I ordered the creation of this committee.   Dr. Faden and the others did a superb job.  They enlisted many of our nation's most significant  and important medical and scientific-ethicists.    They had to determine first whether experiments conducted or sponsored by our government between 1944 and 1974 met the ethical and scientific ·standards of that time and of our time.

Miners working in those mines were exposed to levels of radiation known to be dangerous  because the  United States did not ensure that the mines were adequately ventilated. As a result hundreds of miners contracted or will contract fatal lung cancer.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. This memorandum does not appear to be pre-decisional or deliberative, but rather provides background information and a decision deadline.

In. these cases, RECA provides $100,000 in compensation per uranium miner. In practice, RECA does not accomplish this goal because documenting exact exposures is too difficult and because the scientific premises underlying RECA are not accurate.

In responding to ACHRE, the Administration's policy has been to be as generous as is reasonable because the government's actions in these cases denied fair protection to individuals, and undermined democratic control over the government. According to ACHRE's chair, Dr. Ruth  Faden, expanded  compensation for uranium miners is one of the most strongly-felt of ACHRE's recommendations.	This memorandum would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch.

Under RECA, people living downwind  of certain areas are compensated  ($50,000) if they  get  a radiogenic disease--even though the probability is very low (<10%) that the disease  was caused by the government's action. In addition, because RECA is not currently based on a probabilistic standard, a significant number of uranium miners who fall within the 20%-50% probability range in Option A are already eligible for compensation.  Option  A  would overcome some of these inequities.

Scientific evidence indicates that downwinders were exposed to much lower levels of radiation and, therefore, a much smaller increased risk of cancer, than were uranium miners. Therefore, the argument goes, it is unfair to allow downwinders whose probability of causation is below 50% to recover compensation while denying such recovery to uranium miners.

For example, the geographical limits on the downwinder population will be subject to expansion. The counties and geographic areas currently specified in the statute exclude persons in adjacent counties and geographic areas where they were exposed to comparable levels of radiation from the nuclear testing program., Moreover, the costs of an expanding program are difficult to predict. For instance, the initial assessment of the cost of the Black Lung Program proved to be dramatically low.

We would draw the policy line short of providing recovery for persons who probably were not injured by the government activities involved. The rule in litigation is that those who sue the government for injuries caused by governmental action must prove that the injuries were caused by the governmental action. [This standard is encompassed in 28 use 1346(b)] In many of these cases the plaintiffs may have a sympathetic case but lack the evidence to prove causation by the preponderance standard.

Once this policy Rubicon is crossed it will be easier for each successive group to muster its arguments that it is also deserving of a special exception.

Mr. Ellenbogen, 41 years old, came to the company in 1996 as president of its entertainment group, a television and video-based unit. In June, he was named president of the entire company, acting as No. 2 to Richard E. Snyder, the parent's 65-year-old chairman and chief executive. At Marvel, he succeeds Joseph Ahearn, who previously said he would resign as soon as a successor was named. Marvel Enterprises was created in October when Marvel Entertainment Group Inc. emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and merged with Toy Biz Inc. It owns the rights to several comic-book characters including ""Spidennan,"" 11X-Men"" and ""Men in Black,"" as well as Fleer/Skybox, a trading-card maker, and the Panini stickers business. Mr. Ellenbogen was credited with building Broadway Video, a television production and distribution company, which Golden Books acquired in 1996. He directed Broadway's acquisition of crucial film and television libraries, including titles such as ""Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" and ""Lassie."" The company said Mr. Snyder now will directly oversee the entertainment unit, which includes home video, merchandising and licensing. Golden Books' nine-month net loss widened sharply to $70.3 million, or $2.77 a share, and revenue fell to $142 million from $ f70 million. It recently reached a preliminary standstill agreement with a group of bondholders to put off interest payments on $100 million in debt. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Golden Books said there is ""substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern."" The company has warned that possible ""restructuring, reduction of costs and other actions"" could result in substantial year-end charges. Earlier this month, it was notified by the Nasdaq Stock Market about the possible delisting of the company's stock for failure to maintain a closing price of at least $5. The shares could be delisted . as early as Dec. 11, though the company says it plans to ""work with the Nasdaq"" to ensure its continued listing. Shares of Golden Books fell 6.25 cents to 43.75 cents in Nasdaq trading, close to a 52-week low. Marvel rose 6.25 cents to $5.9375 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.

With issuance rapidly making up any ground lost in September and early October, worries about a credit crunch are easing, though some participants say the real test will come after Thanksgiving with Seagram's deal and the $2.5 billion anticipated from Monsanto Co., announced two weeks ago. ""The supply overhang that we saw all year is coming to the market and deals are getting done,"" said Greg Hahn, senior vice president and fixed-income portfolio manager at Conseco Capital Management. ""That's a very healthy sign for the market  right now."" The key to Cendant's deal was the high yield on offer, according to investors. That helped to overcome worries about the accounting scandal that has plagued the company this year. ""Obviously  the company has had its accounting problems, but you can't  beat"" the yield on offer relative to Treasurys, said John Kowalik, senior vice president and portfolio manager at Oppenheimer Funds. ""If you're a yield  buyer, this would qualify as a candidate."" Lead underwriters Chase Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co. said that even at the increased size, demand outstripped  the bonds available.   The company so/d $400 million of two-year notes at a yield 2.875 percentage points more than comparable Treasurys and $1.15 billion of five-year notes at a yield 3.125 percentage points more than Treasurys.    During the four-day roadshow to market the bond deal, syndicate officials said Cendant focused on the strength of its core businesses and strategy. For much of this year, the company's public image has been beset by an accounting scandal that took place at direct marketer CUC International, which merged with HFS Inc. to form Cendant in late 1997. As a further enticement, Cendant  will increase the coupon on the bond deal by 1.5 percentage points if its ratings are downgraded to junk status by both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's. Currently it is rated Baal by Moody's and triple-B by S&P. In the junk market, Global Crossing's offering of senior exchangeable pay-in-kind preferred securities was doubled from its originally planned size. The securities were priced at par with a 10.5% dividend rate. Level 3's deal was its second offering this year. It sold $3 billion of junk bonds in April and these securities have become a market favorite. During the financial crisis of mid-August to mid-October, ""Level 3 became the only bond you could sell because it was a high-yield benchmark,"" said Jerry Paul, high-yield fund manager Invesco Funds Group, ""and it was knocked down unduly."" Level 3, which has a $10 billion capital plan, ""saw a nice window to get some funds and got the money,"" said one person familiar with the deal.

Adler 03/17/99 02:38:51 PM Record Type:    Record To: Laura Emmett/WHO/EOP cc: Subject: nursing home meeting; ; SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION The proposed legislation would give DOJ three new tools to combat the failure of nursing homes and other residential health care facilities to treat residents properly. First, it creates criminal sanctions for organizations or individuals who knowingly and willfully engage  in a pattern of  physical  or mental harm to residents. Second, it would create civil penalties that could be imposed on individuals, facility chains, or management companies if they engage in conduct that results in a pattern of  physical  or mental harm to residents. Third,  it would authorize  DOJ to seek injunctive  relief  against these entities or individuals whenever DOJ has reason to suspect  that  they are engaging  in behavior  that  will  result in harm to physical or mental harm to residents. DOJ would have to consult  with HHS before invoking  its injunctive authority.	This document would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This document appears to be a summary of proposed legislation, which would not fall under the category of privileged communication.

Adler 03/17/99 02:38:51 PM Record Type:    Record To: Laura Emmett/WHO/EOP cc: Subject: nursing home meeting; ; OUTSTANDING ISSUES HHS is primarily concerned about the overlap in enforcement  authority  that these  new provisions would create. As currently drafted, the only area of facility noncompliance that would not pose the problem of overlapping authority for both agencies would be those cases where violations are minimal  or where the harm to residents is isolated. HHS is concerned  that  in situations  where both agencies have an interest in initiating an enforcement action, DOJ will push HCFA to delay its enforcement action, since DOJ's need  to build a solid case for conviction  may not coincide  with  HCFA's  need to act swiftly when needed. In addition, HHS is concerned that  DOJ  will develop  its own quality standards for individual facilities and chains when deciding whether to initiate prosecution, thus requiring facilities to comply with one set of standards developed by HCFA  and another  set of standards developed by DOJ.	The passage would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged inter-agency or intra-agency communications. The passage appears to be an internal communication between HHS and DOJ regarding concerns about overlapping enforcement authority and potential conflicts between the agencies' needs to act swiftly and build a solid case for conviction. As such, it is likely a privileged communication that would be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.

Adler 03/17/99 02:38:51 PM Record Type:    Record To: Laura Emmett/WHO/EOP cc: Subject: nursing home meeting; ; DOJ feels that the overlap in enforcement authority is limited to enforcement action in individual facilities. Currently, no one has the authority to prosecute nursing home chains for repeated violations, which this statute would provide to DOJ. In addition, this policy would not preclude  HHS from taking any action to protect the health and safety of residents, and DOJ is willing to codify this in an MOU.	This email would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The email appears to be discussing legal strategy and potential enforcement actions, which could be considered privileged. Additionally, the email is between two government agencies (DOJ and HHS), which could further support the argument for exemption 5 protection.

Adler 03/17/99 02:38:51 PM Record Type:    Record To: Laura Emmett/WHO/EOP cc: Subject: nursing home meeting; ; PROPOSED DPC POSITION Modify the DOJ proposal to limit their new enforcement authority to criminal violations and require HHS to propose new legislation providing the111 with new authority to impose civil penalties. Under this option, the Department of Justice would be allowed to impose new criminal penalties on individuals, facility chains, and management companites who knowingly and willfully engage in a patterns of physical or mental harm to residents. HHS would propose new  legislation creating civil penalties that could be imposed on individuals,  facility chains, or management  companies if they engage in conduct that results in a pattern of physical or mental harm to residents. This compromise provides virtually the same level of enforcement and eliminates the problematic overlap of authority created by the DOJ proposal.

The email does not appear to contain any privileged legal advice or analysis, nor does it involve any deliberative process materials.

BACKGROUND There are approximately 16,800 nursing homes in the United States, serving 1.6 million people. Since HCFA put new regulations in place in 1995, the health and safety of nursing homes has improved. But Senator Grassley will unveil a report next week on the shortcomings in nursing home care, and HCFA will transmit a report to Congress tomorrow concluding that tougher enforcement is needed to ensure high quality in all nursing homes. You will respond to both of these reports with a tough new initiative to crack down on bad apple nursing homes and ensure high quality care.

During the late 1980s, many states established financing schemes that had the effect of increasing their Federal Medicaid funds without using additional state resources. Typically, states would raise funds from health care providers (through provider taxes or ""donations""), then pay back those providers through increased Medicaid payments. Since the Federal government pays at least half of Medicaid payments, the provider taxes or donations would be repaid in large part by Federal matching payments. Using this mechanism, the state was left with a net gain because it only had to repay part of the provider tax or donation it originally received.  This led to an unprecedented drain on the Federal Treasury - the major reason why Federal Medicaid costs more than doubled between 1988 and 1992."

Because provider taxes and donations were effectively siphoning off potentially billions of dollars from the Federal Treasury, the Congress limited states' use of these schemes in a bill enacted by President Bush in 1991.  It is important to note that the subsequent regulatory interpretation of these limits -- the very regulations that we are now planning to enforce -- was negotiated with the states and the National Governors' Association in 1993.	It is possible that this memorandum could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

Despite the new law and the regulations, many states continued to use provider taxes that at least appeared to be out of compliance. To date, these possibly impermissible taxes total an estimated $2 to 4 billion and, in the future, will cost billions more. In response, HCFA issued letters and discussed its concerns about certain taxes with states, but -- for a variety of reasons -- never took any final action (called a ""disallowance""). Unfortunately, this has meant that a number of states have continued using these taxes, believing that HCFA might never enforce the law, or that if they did, they could seek recourse through the White House or the Congress. (In fact, since we do not have a good track record on enforcement, budget examiners at CBO and in the Administration have already written off Federal revenue raised through these provider taxes; this is important to know since it means we could waive past ""abuses"" retrospectively and it might not be scored as a cost.)"

Both in writing and orally we repeatedly objected to this provision. Moreover, we provided alternative statutory language that would have addressed about two-thirds (over $ I billion worth) of the problem. As you know, however, the Senators (through their staff) rejected our offer and insisted on their original provisions.	This document may be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The memorandum appears to be an internal communication between high-level officials discussing a legislative provision and their objections to it. The fact that they provided alternative language suggests that they were actively involved in the legislative process, which could make this document part of the deliberative process privilege. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances and whether any other exemptions apply.

In announcing the line-item veto on August 11, we raised concerns about the cost and ramifications of singling out as permissible one state's provider taxes. Although our actions were generally viewed as responsible and defensible by those who know the program and/or who are budget experts, the same clearly cannot be said of New York's political establishment. The Governor's office, the New York Congressional delegation, the Mayor, providers and unions reacted strongly and negatively to the veto.  Among a host of complaints, they charged that they were singled out and were never made aware that this provision could be subject to the line item veto. Most recently they have criticized us for our . delay in getting back to them and our willingness to support fixes for the other two vetoed provisions without addressing their problem.	It is possible that this memorandum could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The memorandum appears to be an internal communication between high-level officials discussing a controversial policy decision and the negative reaction it received from a particular state. The content of the memorandum suggests that it may contain frank and candid discussions about the decision-making process and the potential legal and political implications of the line-item veto. However, whether or not the memorandum is actually protected under exemption 5 would depend on a number of factors, including the specific nature of the communication, the context in which it was created, and the agency's justification for withholding it.

In August, we began a review of the options to address provider taxes in New York and other states. At the time, we well knew that this action would force us to finally attempt to move to enforce laws against provider taxes in all 36 states that may be out of compliance. We also knew that we had to take this position to support our justification for the line-item veto that no individual state be singled out for special treatment.

We believe that our discussion with New York next Wednesday about their provider tax status necessitates that we concurrently release similar information to every other potentially affected state. Three types of actions resulting from this comprehensive review will be announced. First, HCFA will clarify its interpretation of the law and correct the regulation affecting one of the largest New York provider taxes.

Two more states, New York and Louisiana, will also receive this news, but it will be in a letter that also provides some good news about other provider taxes in their states.

(Nine other states who are in one of the top two categories will get similar requests.) For these states, we simply do not have sufficient information to determine the legality of at least some of their taxes.  As we discuss this issue with these states, however, we will also make certain they are aware that they may be eligible for waivers that make their taxes permissible and/or that the provision of additional information may well clarify the legality of their taxes.

The follow up to these letters will be, we hope, immediate discussions between HCFA and the states. Our primary goal is to protect the Federal Treasury prospectively. We may have to trade getting only a fraction of the retrospective disallowed taxes in return for expeditious agreements to prevent future use of impermissible taxes.

Very few of the states who receive notices will be pleased. For example, although HCFA is relieving approximately two-thirds of New York's past impermissible tax claims (worth over $1 billion), there is still at least $500 million in taxes that HCFA probably cannot consider legal. The New York delegation has already put us on notice that nothing less than a ""hold harmless"" solution is acceptable.

The HHS report released today recommends building on this legislation and enacting a bill that protects all Americans from the threat of genetic discrimination.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications, such as those between an attorney and client or those involving deliberative processes within an agency. The passage provided does not contain any such privileged information, but rather discusses proposed legislation and a recommendation from a government report.

It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. If the information pertains to ongoing discussions or deliberations within the government about potential policy changes related to preventing insurance discrimination based on genetic information, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, if the information is already publicly available or does not pertain to privileged communications, it would not be protected under exemption 5.

The Genome Action Plan, which consists of nearly one hundred groups -- including AARP, National Organization of Rare Disorders, National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, Parkinson's Disease Foundation, and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and the March of Dimes -- is willing to design an event with us in order to highlight our report and support legislation on genetic discrimination. They are proposing an event that would take place at the National Academy of Sciences, which would include remarks by a few of their members and a couple of victims of genetic discrimination and the President or Vice President. NAS holds about 600 people. If we want a specific event for this, they are willing to design it as a legislative conference -- which would be appropriate since they too are about ready to announce their support of the Slaughter legislation.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The information provided in this passage does not involve any such privileged communication. It is discussing a potential event with outside groups and their support for legislation on genetic discrimination.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; PREVENTING INSURANCE DISCRIMINATION BASED ON GENETIC INFORMATION; ; Event in conjunction with announcement on new gene discovery. Apparently, there is a new gene discovery on a well-known late adulthood disease that is potentially being announced in the next month in Science magazine. Science has not decided when they will publish this gene, although there is fairly good chance they will publish it in late June or early July:  They will be able to notify us between two and three weeks before publication. When they do publish, the Human Genome Institute plans to do a press conference on the discovery. This event -- could highlight the discovery and then emphasize that as we make these new breakthroughs on genetics, we should enact legislation to ensure that this genetic information is not used to discriminate against people. (Even if we do not want to use this to highlight the genetic screening legislation, we may want to consider some possible POTUS involvement). This event is not necessarily mutually exclusive from the event with the Genome Action Plan.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The discussion of potential legislation and involvement from the President could be considered privileged communications related to the agency's decision-making process. However, it ultimately depends on the specific context and content of the communication.

This group is holding their annual awards event on June 24th, where they will give awards in the areas such as basic research, clinical research, and public policy. We could issue our report and announce our support for genetic screening legislation at that event. This event would obviously emphasize women's concerns about genetic screening in breast cancer.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The event and report described do not involve government agencies or privileged communications, and therefore would not fall under this exemption.

The drug-control challenges we face along the Southwest Border, though severe, are not insurmountable. About 60 percent of the cocaine entering the U.S. does so across this border, yet seizures in the border region are declining. Total 1998 cocaine seizures are projected to be less than half of the annual average seized between 1991 and 1996 and account for just a fifth of the cocaine crossing the border. Heroin seizures have declined by about a third since 1996. Over the past several years, the general trend has been one of fewer seizures of all drugs except marijuana.

The July 24 letter was the centerpiece of an announcement by the Vice-President. Now-senator Torricelli, Reps. Pallone and Menendez, environmentalists and labor representatives joined the announcement. Companies and the Port were also supportive. While we talked to the states in advance we did not try to bring them to the announcement. The basic deal we announced was to get dredging moving by allowing use of the ocean site, and to close the ocean site to contaminated material after September 1997.	The content of this note would likely not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. While the note may contain sensitive information related to the NY-NJ dredging issue, it does not appear to be a privileged communication between government agencies or officials. Rather, it appears to be a communication between two individuals, one of whom happens to be a government official. Therefore, the content of the note would likely be subject to disclosure under FOIA.

This interagency problem stands out in my  I0 years of government experience.	The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement is a communication between two government officials discussing a problem within their agencies, and it relates to the delivery of commitments in a deal. As such, it is likely part of the decision-making process and would be exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.

Caq(i!IJell 8 Diane Regas M   M- SUBJECT:    Summary of the Healthy Port Initiative for New Yo1·k Harbor; ;     I. Summary Inadequate dredging of the channels and berthing  areas serving  the Port of  New  York  and New Jersey, and the lack of leadership to solve the problem, have caused several major port companies to announce that they may  relocate their hub operations to Halifax,  Nova Scotia, or to other U.S. ports. Company decisions are expected in June or July. Fearful of job losses to Canada, the longshoremen have focused pressure to resolve dredging  issues on  Governors Pataki and Whitman. Concurrently, concern about disposal of contaminated dredged  material off New Jersey's coast has prompted Governor Whitman to criticize the  Administration's disposal policies as environmentally unsound. Her message has been lauded and reinforced by environmental groups and New Jersey shore communities, but it has further impeded needed dredging.	The memorandum would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The memorandum appears to be an internal communication between two individuals within the government, discussing a policy issue and potential solutions. As such, it could be considered a privileged communication that is exempt from disclosure under FOIA.

Caq(i!IJell 8 Diane Regas M   M- SUBJECT:    Summary of the Healthy Port Initiative for New Yo1·k Harbor; ; The primary obstacle to full-scale dredging is the lack of acceptable disposal alternatives. Disposal alternatives are primarily a state responsibility, but  require federal  action. On  May 24, in an agreement with labor leaders, Governor Whitman promised that limited dredging of berthing areas would begin in June. We understand  that Governor  Whitman  is planning  a press conference on June 6 to announce the start of dredging, but port companies and unions remain highly skeptical. A visible, credible signal is therefore still needed to persuade the unions, port companies, and state governments that the  Administration  is  ready  to  get dredging moving as soon  as the states do their  part. We also  must  disarm  possible criticism on the environmental issues. Thus, the initiative  proposed  here is in  large  measure preemptive: we are increasing pressure on Whitman and Pataki to make tough decisions about local disposal options while protecting the President from  blame  either  for  imminent  job losses or for potential harm to the oceans. At  the same  time,  we  must  take care  not  to suggest too much Federal ""ownership"" of a problem that  inherently  must stay  on  the governors' doorsteps. The governors, not the Administration, must resolve politically divisive decisions about local disposal sites, and must negotiate between  themselves  the  relative benefits New York and New Jersey receive from Port Authority monies earmarked for dredging."	This document may be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The memorandum appears to contain internal deliberations and strategy discussions related to the Healthy Port Initiative for New York Harbor. The authors discuss the need to pressure state governors to make tough decisions about disposal options while protecting the President from blame, and they caution against suggesting too much federal ownership of the problem.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Summary; ;     • The Mud Dump Site (MDS): A dredge  material  disposal  site offshore  but  near Pallone's district. Federal law and policy now allows  disposal  of  category  I  and category 2 dredge material  at  this site.  (Category  I  is clean;  category  2 passes  tests but has some contamination; category 3 is not suitable for disposal in the ocean.) Governor Whitman has pledged not  to  put category  2 in  the  ocean,  and  that  pledge has been strongly endorsed by environmental groups and  shore  newspapers,  but there  are very few alternatives for category 2 disposal in the short  term.  Our  initiative proposed a decision by January 31, 1997 concerning the phase out of the Mud Dump Site, with the consideration of the alternatives for disposal.	The information provided in this summary does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The information is factual and does not involve any internal agency communications or deliberations.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Summary; ;     • The EPA testing rule. This is a proposed rule revising  the regulations  governing how and when to test for contamination  in dredge material.    A New Jersey federal court opinion argues that EPA's technical manuals conflict with its underlying regulation -- rendering permits legally vulnerable. Environmentalists have derided EPA's rule as a ""rollback""  of ocean protection. Unions and port operators want the rule finalized as soon as possible, believing the rule change essential if permits to dispose material at the MDS are to survive court challenges. Our initiative proposed EPA action on the rule by August 1, I 996."	It is possible that some portions of this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. Specifically, any internal discussions or communications related to the proposed EPA testing rule and its potential legal vulnerabilities could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, any information related to the rule itself, including its proposed changes and the timeline for EPA action, would likely not be protected under exemption 5 and would be subject to disclosure under FOIA.

Wants  EPA  to finalize  its rule in August, to provide certainty to permit applicants.	"It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

Want  EPA  to postpone  its rule indefinitely.    In offering these proposals, Torricelli and Pallone are negotiating, in part, on behalf of the environmental groups whose support they  need  in  the  corning  elections.  (Representative  Zimmer, Torriceili's opponent in  the current  Senate  race,  reportedly  has  prepared advertisements castigating Torricelli for supporting ocean dumping.)	This would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not fall under the category of inter-agency or intra-agency communications.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Summary; ; Recommendation	It is not possible to determine whether the summary and recommendation would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 without additional context. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. If the summary and recommendation were part of such communications, they may be protected under exemption 5. However, if they are simply routine documents or do not contain privileged or confidential information, they would not be protected under exemption 5.

Explain your reasoning.; ; Summary; ; We recommend that the Administration make a counter-proposal to Pallone and  Torricelli, with the following elements:	It is possible that this recommendation could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the recommendation was made as part of an internal deliberative process, such as a discussion between agency officials about how to respond to a proposal from outside parties, it could be considered pre-decisional and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, if the recommendation was already implemented or finalized, it would not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this recommendation is exempt from FOIA would depend on the specific circumstances surrounding its creation and use.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Summary; ;     • We would immediately begin  administrative  action  to close  the MDS  to category  2 at the end I997. This action would require a public proposal (this summer), a comment period, and a final  decision  (early  I997).  We  would  make  the  proposal and indicate our intention to close the  site,  but  would  not  pre-judge  the  final outcome of this process.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language used in the summary suggests that the decision-making process is ongoing and that the agency has not yet made a final decision. As such, the communication could be considered pre-decisional and deliberative, and therefore exempt from disclosure under exemption 5. Additionally, the mention of a public proposal and comment period suggests that the agency is following a formal process, which could further support the argument for exemption.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Summary; ;     • We would insist that the MDS be available as necessary until the end of 1997 for disposal of category 1 and 2 material. This  may  require  an  increase  in elevation  at the site.	Yes, this could potentially be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing a decision or recommendation related to the disposal of hazardous materials, which could be considered a deliberative process within an agency. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific context and whether any exemptions apply.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Summary; ;     • We would agree to delay the EPA rule until  all of the issues  have  been  discussed with environmentalists and other stakeholders, including a process to  examine scientific issues related to the rule. We anticipate  that  this  process  will  take  six to ten months.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The statement appears to be a communication between government officials discussing a potential delay of an EPA rule and the process for examining scientific issues related to the rule. This type of communication would likely be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Summary; ;     • We would require, as a condition of these  commitments,  that  key  environmental groups agree to not challenge permits to dispose of category I and 2 material  at  the MDS (using the existing testing rule) until the end of I997.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language in this summary suggests that there may be ongoing negotiations or discussions between the agency and environmental groups, and that this statement is part of those discussions. As such, it may be considered a privileged communication that is exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Summary; ; Pros: This proposal is very close to that outlined by Pallone and Torricelli,  except  that we would use an appropriate administrative process  to  decide  on  closure  of  the  MDS  rather than announcing closure by fiat, and we  would  reject  the strict  volume  limitation  they propose in the interim. We would expect  that this will  disarm  environmental  criticism  and help move short-term dredging, but we would  want  to  elicit  an  understanding  with  New York and New Jersey that they will not be criticize short-term use of the MDS.	It is possible that this document could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language used in the proposal suggests that it may be a communication between government officials discussing a potential administrative process for closure of the MDS and how to address environmental criticism. However, without more context it is difficult to determine if this document meets the criteria for exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Summary; ; Cons: It will be difficult to convince  Representative  Menendez  that  this  approach  makes sense. Our position will be that  this  approach  will  accomplish  what  he  needs  by  ensuring that dredging can go on for the next year, while allowing  continued  use of the  MDS  for the very short term: In addition it will allow the EPA rule issues to  be  resolved  in  a  less contentious climate, after  further  work  with  affected  interests,  thereby  reducing  the likelihood  of  litigation  over  the rule itself.    We will need to work  closely  with  Menendez and his staff to help them understand the merits of delaying the rule, and enlist their help in persuading the unions and port companies that this  is the right course.  We  propose  to have those discussions in	particular with Menendez and his staff be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications such as attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and executive privilege. ; ; The language in the summary suggests that the authors are discussing a strategy for convincing Representative Menendez to delay a rule and enlist his help in persuading others to do the same. This type of communication could be considered part of the deliberative process, which is protected under exemption 5. The authors are discussing potential arguments and strategies, which are not final decisions or actions, but rather part of the internal decision-making process. ; ; Additionally, the language suggests that the authors may be seeking to work closely with Menendez and his staff to help them understand the merits of delaying the rule. This type of communication could be considered attorney-client communication, as the authors are providing advice and guidance to Menendez and his staff. ; ; Overall, the language in the summary suggests that the communication may be protected under FOIA exemption 5. However, it is important to note that the determination of whether a communication is protected under exemption 5 is highly fact-specific and can depend on the specific context and content of the communication.
