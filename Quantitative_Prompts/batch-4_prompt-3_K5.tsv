On separate returns, each spouse would report their own earnings. Unearned income could be reallocated by shifting assets. Rules specify how deductions, exemptions,  and  credits split. Would significantly reduce marriage penalties, but would also increase some marriage bonuses. Provides only limited or even no benefit to stay-at-home parents. Would substantially increase filing burdens. Income Splitting (Ashcroft and others) $36 billion oo year (in 1999 income levels) Single filing, with half of a couple's income, including earned income, attributed to each spouse. Would significantly reduce marriage penalties, but also greatly increase marriage bonus es. Would help stay-at-home parents. Adds some complexity to filing. Make Joint Tax Parameters Double Singles Roughly $36 billion per year (in 1999 income levels) /2 The standard deduction and rate brackets for joint filers would be made twice the corresponding amounts for single filers. . Basically equivalent results to income splitting, but much simpler since no additional computations are required.

This is the largest publicly funded anti-drug campaign, with a total proposed budget of $1 billion over five years and a dollar-for-dollar match from each media outlet airing the ads. Using the full power of the mass media to change youth attitudes toward drugs, the campaign will ensure that when teens and adults turn on the television, listen to the radio, or surf the Internet, they will get the message that drugs are dangerous, wrong, and can kill you. Children are exposed to many media messages that normalize drugs.  The campaign will utilize modem media and technology to give alternative messages that will compete with these influences.

This document appears to be a memo from Bruce Reed, who was the Director of the White House Domestic Policy Council at the time, to an unspecified recipient regarding a public event to launch a national anti-drug media campaign. The information in the memo does not appear to be privileged or confidential, and does not involve any internal deliberations or decision-making processes within a government agency.

Young people here in Atlanta say that the ads make them realize the serious consequences of using drugs.

And we've had some success. We supported remarkable efforts by the Coast Guard, for example, to cut off drugs before they get to this country. But  we can never  cut  off  the  whole  flow.  And every time I'd do this, some leader of a country where drugs are grown will say: You know, Mr. President, you're right,  we have a lot of poor farmers in our country, and I wish they'd grow something else. But America has four percent of the  world's people and you're buying almost 50 percent of the world's drugs. Nobody is making you buy those drugs. So you can say whatever you want to us.

And these things make you do really bad things. They make you abuse other people. Most of the people selling drugs on the street are out there  supporting  their  own  habits. So you take other people, people who are basically good people, and you turn them into animals, because they don't care what they do to anybody else because they've got to get the money if they have to destroy somebody else, so they can keep feeding their own habits. They destroy  families.  Mothers  who love their  sons wind up neglecting them, abusing them, walking away, weakening the family. Everybody gets hurt. Nobody in America is free of this.

The Drug Use Forecasting [""DUF""] statistics (released in July 1996) confirmed that methamphetamine use was highest in western and southwestern locales. According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network [""DAWN""], between 1989 and 1995, the estimated number of nationwide emergency-room drug abuse episodes involving methamphetamine     • doubled, and between 1991 and 1994, the number of methamphetamine deaths nearly tripled."
