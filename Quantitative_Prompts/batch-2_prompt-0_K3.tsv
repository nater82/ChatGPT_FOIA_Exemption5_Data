D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; TEXT: I understand from Mike that he prepared a draft proposal for a WH Conference on education and perhaps some other meetings with specific constituencies to include mayors for you to review recently. When do you suppose it will be ready for circulation for comment by IGA and others?    I am hopeful that we may be in a position to announce at least the mayor segment when the President meets with the USCM winter meeting attendees for breakfast in the WH on January 30. Thanks.

However, it would ultimately depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the communication.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Presidential Directive on Coerced Abstinence in the Criminal Justice System January 12, 1998	It is possible that the Presidential Directive on Coerced Abstinence in the Criminal Justice System could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by executive privilege. However, the determination of whether or not the directive is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances surrounding its creation and the reasons for its classification.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Announcement     • Today, the President directed the Attorney General to take the necessary steps to: (1) require states to determine the level of drug use in their prisons and report annually on their progress;  (2) grant states the flexibility to use their federal prison funds for drug detection, offender testing and drug treatment; and (3) work """"1th states to enact stiffer penalties for drug trafficking into and within correctional facilities.  The President also announced that his FY 1999 budget will include nearly $200 million for a series of initiatives to promote coerced abstinence and treatment in the criminal justice system."	It is possible that some portions of this announcement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. However, without more information about the specific context and content of the announcement, it is difficult to determine definitively whether exemption 5 would apply.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Towards a National Policy of Coerced Abstinence     • Last week, Columbia University's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) released a study confirming the need for coerced abstinence and treatment in the criminal justice system. CASA's study found that 1.4 million offenders -- or 80% of the I. 7 million criminals in prison and jails -- were either high on drugs or alcohol when arrested, stole property to buy drugs, or have a history of drug and alcohol abuse. Many other studies also confirm that the majority of individuals in the criminal justice system have similar drug histories.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The passage provided does not fall under this category.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • Testing to Measure Progress.  Under current law and federal guidelines, states are required to submit drug testing and intervention plans for their federal prison grant funding. The President's directive calls on the Attorney General to amend the guidelines to require states to also include a baseline report of their prison drug  abuse problem, and to report every year thereafter to chart the progress they are making to reduce drug use and availability. The directive also encourages states to expand their efforts to include other offenders involved in the criminal justice system	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The information described in the statement appears to be related to a federal guideline and a directive from the President, which would not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • Helping States Get the Job Done. Today's directive asks the Attorney General to draft and transmit to the Congress legislation that will grant states the flexibility to use their federal prison construction and substance abuse treatment funds to provide the full range of drug testing, sanctions and treatment for offenders under criminal justice supervision. With this added flexibility, states could tap into the nearly $8 billion in prison funds authorized by the 1994 Crime Law (about $2 billion of which already have been appropriated to date).	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • Keeping Drugs Out of Prisons. Finally, the President's directive calls on the Attorney General to work with the states to enhance their penalties for drug trafficking into and within correctional facilities. The 1994 Omnibus Crime Bill contains tough penalties for similar crimes. The President believes we must have ""zero tolerance"" for drug use and trafficking within our nation's prison system. Automated Records Management System Hex-Dump Conversion"	No, the statement about enhancing penalties for drug trafficking in correctional facilities and the 1994 Omnibus Crime Bill would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. However, the information about the Automated Records Management System Hex-Dump Conversion may be protected under exemption 5 if it is considered privileged communication between government officials.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A Record of Accomplishment     • President Clinton has consistently promoted a policy of drug testing, sanctions and treatment for offenders.  Specifically, he has:	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications, such as those between an attorney and client or those that would reveal internal deliberations of government agencies. The statement about President Clinton's policy on drug testing, sanctions, and treatment for offenders is a matter of public record and would not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Pushed for Drug Testing and Intervention in the 50 States.  The  President  fought for and signed the legislation  requiring states to drug test prisoners  and  parolees as  a condition  for  receiving prison grants.        States must now submit comprehensive drug testing and intervention plans for prisoners and parolees by March 1998 and implement  them  by September 1998.   Today's actions directly build on this effort	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Doubled the Number of Federal Arrestees Tested. President Clinton directed the Attorney General to create a program to drug test federal criminal defendants. Operation Drug TEST (Testing, Effective Sanctions and Treatment) was established and funded a pilot program to immediately test defendants upon their arrest. In FY 1997, data from 24 judicial districts indicated that 56% of defendants (9,308) were tested -- a dramatic increase over the 28% (4,929) of defendants tested in the previous year. There was also a 190% increase in drug treatment for defendants over the same period.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example does not fall under this exemption.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Expanded Testing and  Treatment  in  Federal  Prisons. Through  his  budgets and the 1994 Crime Act, the President has promoted coerced abstinence in the federal prison system.    In 1997 federal prisoners were subjected to nearly 130,000 drug tests.  Additionally, the number of inmates required to receive treatment increased by 3-fold (from 5,450 in FY 1993 to 17,943 in FY 1997).	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example does not fall under this exemption.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Multiplied the Number of Drug Courts.       As part of the 1994 Crime Act, the President fought to launch a $1 billion initiative to spread Drug Courts across the country. Drug Courts use drug testing, sanctions and -- when necessary -­ treatment  to cut  crime and addiction.    Drug Courts have increased from a mere handful in 1993 to more than 200 that are operational today.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications, such as those between government officials and their advisors. The statement provided does not contain any such communication and is therefore not subject to exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Increased  Resources in  FY 1999 Budget.    The President's FY 1999 Budget will continue the Administration's policy of drug testing, sanctions and treatment.  In particular, the budget includes $192 million for the following programs: -- $85 million for a new Drug Testing Initiative -- $30 million to add more Drug Courts -- $4.7 million for Operation Drug Test -- $5 million for demonstration to combat teenage drug use -- $72 million for treatment in state prisons	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. However, it would depend on the specific context in which this information was created and shared. If it was part of a deliberative process within the administration, it may be protected. If it was simply a public announcement of budget priorities, it may not be protected.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; ''Zero Tolerance""lnitiative for Drugs in Prison Questions and Answers January 12, 1998"	"It is possible that the ""Zero Tolerance"" initiative for drugs in prison Questions and Answers document could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and deliberative process privilege. If the document contains legal advice or analysis, or if it reflects the agency's internal deliberations or decision-making process, it may be exempt from disclosure under this exemption. However, the specific circumstances of the document's creation and content would need to be evaluated to determine whether exemption 5 applies."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q.  What is the President announcing today?	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any deliberative process or privileged communication within the government.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     A. Today, the President signed a directive to the Attorney General calling on her to take the necessary steps to:	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;         (1) Require states to determine the level of drug use in their prisons and report annually on their progress.   Under current law and federal guidelines, states are required to submit drug testing and intervention plans for their federal prison grant funding. The President's directive calls on the Attorney General to amend the guidelines to require states to also include a baseline report of their prison drug abuse problem, and to report every year thereafter to chart the progress they are making to reduce drug use and availability.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it pertains to a directive from the President and would not fall under the category of privileged communications within the executive branch.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;         (2) Give states the flexibilitv to use their federal prison funds for drug detection, offender testing, and drug treatment. The Attorney General will draft and transmit to the Congress legislation to give states the flexibility to use their federal prison construction and substance abuse treatment funds for the full range of drug testing, sanctions, and treatment for offenders under criminal justice supervision. This will allow states to tap into the nearly $8 billion in prison funds authorized by the 1994 Crime Law (about $2 billion of which already have been appropriated to date).	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications. It is a proposal for legislation and therefore would not fall under any of the FOIA exemptions.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;         (3) Work with states to enact stiffer penalties for drug trafficking into and within correctional facilities.   Finally, the President's directive calls on  the  Attorney General to consult with the states to enhance their penalties for drug trafficking into and within correctional facilities. The 1994 Omnibus Crime Bill contains tough penalties for similar crimes. The President believes we must have ''zero tolerance"" for drug use and trafficking within our nation's prison system."	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications or deliberations.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The President also announced that his FY 99 budget will include $] 97 million for a series of initiatives to promote coerced abstinence and treatment in the criminal justice system-­ including $85 million for a new drug testing and sanctions program for states and localities.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement appears to be a public announcement made by the President and would not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q.  How bad is the problem'! Is this directive really needed?	As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or beliefs. However, the question does not appear to contain any information that would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A.      While crime rates continue to drop and overall drug use is down, illegal drugs remain an enormous factor  behind  the level of crime and violence  in America.  Drug addicts are involved in approximately 3 to 5 times the  number of criminal  incidents as arrestees  who do not use drugs. Last week, Columbia University's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) released a study confirming the need for coerced abstinence and treatment in the criminal justice system. CASA's study found that 1.4 million offenders -- or 80% of the 1.7 million criminals in prison and jails -- were either high on drugs or alcohol when arrested, stole property to buy drugs, or have a history of drug and alcohol abuse.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Drug test results and anecdotal information reveal that even while incarcerated, offenders can gain access to drugs. In drug tests conducted last year, approximately 2 percent of offenders in federal prison and roughly 9 percent of inmates in state facilities tested positive for drugs.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; President Clinton believes that our criminal justice system should reduce drug demand -­ not prolong, enhance, or tolerate it. We know that drug testing and treatment can help to break the cycle of drugs and crime.  Convicted offenders who undergo drug testing and treatment while in prisons and after release are approximately twice as likely to stay drug-free and crime-free as those offenders who do not receive drug testing and treatment. Today's directive and the resources proposed in the President's budget will help us get to zero tolerance for drugs in prison and to helps state to cut crime and recidivism linked to drug abuse.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q.  How is this different from previous actions taken by this Administration to address this issue? Is this anything new?	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve predecisional or deliberative information, attorney-client communications, or certain types of privileged information. It is a general question about the actions taken by the administration and does not involve any sensitive or confidential information.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A   The President's action today builds on his strong record of accomplishment in this area. In 1996, the President launched the first comprehensive effort to  address  the drug problem in our state criminal justice systems. President Clinton fought for and signed legislation to require states-- whose criminal justice systems  house the vast majority of drug dependent offenders-- to drug test prisoners and parolees as a condition of receiving federal prison grants.    Under the President's initiative, states must submit comprehensive plans of drug testing and intervention for prisoners and parolees by March 1, 1998 and implement them by September 1, 1998.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications or deliberations.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Today's directive complements  the President's earlier initiative   by helping us to chart the states' efforts to  reduce drug use and availability in  their prisons.      The directive also makes more resources available to states to help them get the job done	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer without additional context. However, based on the information provided, it is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. If this statement was part of an internal communication between government officials discussing policy decisions or strategy, it may be exempt from disclosure under this exemption.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The President has taken numerous other actions to combat the problem of drug abuse by offenders involved in the criminal justice system including: doubling the number of federal arrestees drug tested in 24 judicial districts; fighting to launch a $1 billion initiative to spread Drug Courts across the country; and expanding drug testing, intervention and treatment in Federal prisons through his budgets and the 1994 Crime Act.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or deliberations. It is a statement of actions taken by the President and does not involve any internal government communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q.  Is the federal government tracking the problem of drug use in its own prisons? What are you doing about the drug problem in federal prisons?	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and certain law enforcement records. However, it would depend on the specific context and content of the information being requested.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A       Under the leadership of Attorney General Reno, the federal Bureau of Prisons is carrying out model programs in drug testing, drug treatment, and drug detection.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement does not fall under either of those categories.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Drug Testing.   In 1997, federal inmates were subject to 127,460 drug tests. Two percent of tests were positive, as compared to the 9 percent average for state correctional systems. Prisoners testing positive for drugs arc appropriately punished and follow up tests are scheduled regularly to ensure they stay clean. Drug testing of correctional officers, and other selected employees is also an established policy in the Federal Bureau of Prisons.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and certain law enforcement records. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the drug testing policy and its implementation. If the information is deemed to be part of a deliberative process or involves attorney-client communications, it may be exempt from disclosure. However, if the information is purely factual and does not involve any privileged communications, it may not be exempt. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to release the information would be up to the agency in question and subject to review by the courts if challenged.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Drug Treatment. In compliance  with  the 1994 Crime  Law, drug  treatment  is  provided to 100 percent of  eligible inmates prior to their  release from Bureau custody.    In fY 97, nearly 31,000 inmates participated in Bureau treatment  programs.  The number of institutions offering residential treatment has grown from 32 to 42 since FY 1994.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Drug Detection. Innovative drug detection technology is being piloted at Bureau institutions.   The Office of National Drug Control Policy is working with the Bureau to provide the states with information on Lhe best ways to keep drugs out of prisons.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. However, it would depend on the specific context and content of the information.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q.  Is this new reporting requirement for states on their prison drug problem tantamount to an unfunded mandate on states?	No, this question would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve privileged communications or deliberative process. It is a straightforward question about a policy issue.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A.      No. By  law, states  must  develop  and implement  plans  for drug testing  and  intervention as a condition of receiving  federal  prison construction  grants.  Today's action  means  that as part of those plans, states will need to add infornation on their existing prison drug use problem, and update  that  information  annually.  All 50 state correctional  systems conducted  some form  of drug testing on their  inmates  last year;   yet no comprehensive data exists on the prevalence on drug use in state prisons.  Anecdotal  reports  have shown that certain systems, such as the District of Columbia's corrections department, have had difficulty  keeping  drugs out of prisons.   The baseline information they provide  will  help us to chart states' progress to reduce drug use and availability in their prisons.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In order to provide additional resources for states to promote coerced abstinence and zero tolerance for drugs, the directive calls on the Attorney General to develop legislation to allow states to use their federal prison construction and treatment funds to carry out all of these activities.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The directive involves the Attorney General developing legislation, which could be considered part of the agency's deliberative process. However, whether or not this information is ultimately protected would depend on the specific circumstances and arguments made by the agency in response to a FOIA request.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In addition, the President is proposing $197 million in FY 99 for a series of initiatives to help states promote coerced abstinence and treatment: I) $85 million for a new drug testing, sanctions, and intervention program for states and local criminal justice systems; 2) $30 million for Drug Courts; 3) $4.7 million for the federal Operation Drug Test program; 4) $5 million for a juvenile justice demonstration program to combat teen drug use; and 5) $72 million to continue the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment in State Prisons program.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q.  The President's directive asks the Attorney General to work with states to increase their penalties for smuggling drugs into prisons.   Are there tough penalties for trafficking drugs into federal prisons?	No, this question would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. This question does not involve such communications and is not related to the internal workings of a government agency.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A.      Yes. The 1994 Omnibus Crime Act increased penalties for illegal drug use and smuggling drugs into Federal prisons.  for instance, drug trafficking in Federal prisons can now lead to imprisonment for up to 20 years for smuggling narcotics and methamphetamine, and up to 5 years for trafficking marijuana. ARMS Email System   Page 1 of2	As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to provide a definitive answer to legal questions. However, based on my understanding of FOIA exemption 5, it generally covers privileged communications such as attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and certain deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example does not appear to fall under any of these categories, so it is unlikely to be protected under FOIA exemption 5. It is important to note that the applicability of FOIA exemptions can depend on the specific circumstances and context of the information being requested.

Also, through regular communications with Initiative staff: Board members will receive reports of promising practices for inclusion in speeches as examples of how communities can work toward racial reconciliation. One example could be a reference to Boston' s Team Harmony Project as something that could be replicated elsewhere.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific circumstances and context of the communication. If the communication was part of a deliberative process aimed at developing policy or making decisions, it may be protected. If it was simply a report of factual information, it may not be protected. Ultimately, the determination of whether the information is exempt from FOIA would be made by the agency in question or a court.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     6. Summaries of Advisory Board Meetings and Town Halls	It depends on the content of the summaries. If the summaries contain confidential or privileged information, such as discussions of legal strategy or internal deliberations, they may be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, if the summaries only contain general information about the meetings and discussions, they may not be protected under exemption 5.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Immigration   --  Skills of Immigrants: The attached U.S. News article discusses the issue of whether we should change our legal immigration system to strengthen  preferences for skilled and well-educated prospective  immigrants  over those that are poorly educated  and unskilled.   The current immigration system is set up to favor keeping families intact. Thus, the vast number of legal immigrants are brought to this country through family-based visas, which do  not take into account education or skill level. The article cites a Rand  study proposal  to create a point system of immigration which continues to  give  weight  to  immediate  family  reunification but  would  also give points  for education, language  skills, and work experience. The final report of the Commission on Immigration Reform also recommends a shift  in priority toward  higher skilled immigrants.    Instead creating a point system, the Commission recommends revising skill-based admissions (approximately 100,000 visas) to favor highly-skilled and educated immigrants and eliminating altogether the category of unskilled workers. Though we think that these ideas are well worth exploring, it is unlikely that Congress will want to consider an overhaul of legal immigration this year. Efforts to reduce legal immigration levels were defeated during consideration of the 1996 illegal immigration law.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege, deliberative process privilege, and presidential communications privilege.

Both you and Secretary Riley are in complete agreement that, as a matter of policy, school districts should be (encouraged??? free???) to establish single sex schools as part of the mix of education options.    The Office of Civil Rights has placed its investigation of the compliant on hold, and will take no steps in the foreseeable future to press New York City to change the status of the school.       However, civil rights offices in both Education and Justice believe that such schools ultimately may be difficult to justify under Title IX or Article (relevant Constitutional reference), in part because they have discriminatory admissions policies, and partly because separate schools will inevitably become unequal and to the ultimate disadvantage Automated Records Management System.

They believe that the strongest legal case for permitting single sex schools is an argument that they are an appropriate remedy for past discrimination, such as low academic performance of females in co-educational settings.    Neither of the cognizant Civil Rights offices want to take formal action on this issue, because they believe they will be forced to oppose single-sex schools.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The fact that DPC has been meeting with other government offices and discussing legal arguments related to single-sex schools could be considered privileged information. However, whether or not this exemption would apply would depend on the specific circumstances and the judgment of the agency handling the FOIA request.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Late in December, Secretary Riley and Rudy Crew agreed to appoint small teams of educators from the Education Department and the NYC Schools to work collaboratively to develop the strongest case for the Women's Leadership Academy.

It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communications between Secretary Riley, Rudy Crew, and the small teams of educators.

As you will recall, we did forgo proposing a minimum wage increase when we proposed the Health Security Act because we did not want to load up the costs to employers. The idea of having a defined minimum employer contribution certainly has some merit as it would make a significant contribution to decreasing the number of uninsured.    Having said that, there are a number of political and policy issues that have to be seriously considered prior to pursuing such a proposal.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Health Care -- Medicare HMOs Dropping Benefits: You asked us to respond to recent reports that Medicare lIMOs were dropping benefits because of changes in Medicare reimbursement policies. We have asked HI-IS to review the extent to which this is occurring. However, it is important to note that many independent policy experts believe that payments to HMOs still are, on average, excessive given the fact that they continue to attract disproportionately healthy populations.  They believe that any movement towards reducing 2 benefits are more attributable to HMO ' s desire for adequate profit margins for their investors rather than adjustments in reimbursement issue. In fact, one corporate executive just informed us that Medicare continues to be their number one most profitable player. Having said that, the fact that the BBA is starting to reduce Medicare reimbursements to HMOs will clearly contribute to lower revenues for these health plans. It is important to note that the added benefits in Medicare HMO plans do help encourage beneficiaries to participate in these plans. The outstanding question is whether or not we want to allow payment rates to exceed what is necessary so as to ensure that these additional benefits are in place. Regardless , any move in this direction would be premature until we have better information about the extent to which HMOs are reducing benefits and the reasons behind such a trend. 3	It is possible that some portions of this document could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

Whether the Child Care Proposal Automated Records mentioned in the question would be protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific content and context of the records.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We are developing a child care proposal that will help working families afford child care, make targeted investments to improve the safety and quality of child care, particularly for infants and toddlers, and provide safe, constructive activities for school-age children. To help working families afford child care, the proposal: (1) increases funding for federal child care subsidies through the Child Care and Development Block Grant; and (2) changes the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit by raising the percentage of child care expenses  for which a  taxpayer may take a credit and by increasing the income levels of taxpayers who may  claim it. Currently, the credit rate is phased down from 30% for taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $10,000 or less to 20% for taxpayers with AGI above $28,000.  We are considering a series of options, including raising the credit rate from 50% for taxpayers with AGI of $30,000 to 20% for those with AGI above $59,000.)  We are also considering targeted investments to improve  the safety and quality of care.    First, the proposal adds funding to the scholarship program for child care providers, which you announced at the child care conference and  which has  received strong support. Second, it includes a new program that will ensure safety and healthy early learning and development for children in the critical first years. Third, the proposal provides resources for states to improve their enforcement of health and safety standards, and fourth, it funds parent education, research and technology. Finally, the proposal makes safe, constructive activities for youth during after-school hours more available by creating a new program for school age children and by coordinating existing programs.

It is possible that some documents related to the work of the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and certain law enforcement records. However, the determination of whether specific documents are exempt from disclosure under exemption 5 would depend on the specific content and context of those documents.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Io October, 1995 ACHRE issued its report. ACHRE found that the-government had conducted several thousand human radiation experiments from 1945 to 1975 and that the majority advanced biomedical research. The Committee found, however, that some were conducted unethically. For example, scientists injected plutonium into 18 patients without their knowledge, and researchers conducted experiments on indigent patients and children. ACHRE made 18 recommendations to open the public record, protect human subjects of future research, and compensate those wronged by the government's actions.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In October, 1995 the President received the Advisory Committee's report and made it clear that the report would ""not be left on a shelf to gather dust"" He directed his Cabinet to ""use and build on these recommendations."" Over the past year and a half, the Administration has acted to implement ACHRE's recommendations to improve openness in government, strengthen ethics in human subjects research, and compensate individuals for the government's mistakes."	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government. It is a statement about actions taken by the government in response to a report.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Today's Announcement     • The Administration released Building Public Trust, outlining its comprehensive response to the President's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE). The report summarizes actions to address ACHRE's 18 recommendations.	It is possible that this announcement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. However, more information would be needed to make a definitive determination.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • The Departments of Energy and Justice announced that the government has settled compensation claims with families of all of the known individuals ACHRE recommended for compensation. ACHRE recommended the government compensate the families of 18 subjects of plutonium injection experiments. The government has settled with all 16 families that came forward.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications and deliberative process privilege. The announcement of the settlements could potentially involve discussions and decisions made within the agencies that are protected by this exemption. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances and context of the announcement.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • President Clinton signed a memorandum to strengthen the rights and protections of people participating in secret, government-supported research. ACHRE recommended that subjects of secret experiments have special protections and information. Acting on that recommendation, the President directed agencies today to propose new rules for secret research that would require scientists to: obtain informed consent from all potential subjects of all secret experiments (current rules allow researchers to waive informed consent in certain cases); disclose the identity of the sponsoring agency to potential subjects; and tell potential subjects that an experiment is classified. The new rules would also establish a more independent review process; require the head of the agency conducting secret human research to approve each project; and require permanent records of secret experiments. The President also directed federal agencies to report annually on the number of classified human research projects and the number of subjects in each project. A preliminary review by the Administration's human radiation lnteragency Working Group indicates that the government is not supporting any classified human research at this time; today's directive initiates a formal, routine accounting of secret human studies.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it is a policy directive from the President and not a communication between government agencies or officials that would qualify for the deliberative process privilege.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • The Administration announced proposed amendments to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 to compensate hundreds of uranium miners who would not be compensated under current law. ACHRE found that some deserving miners do not qualify for compensation under the Act. The amendments would establish fairer, science­ based criteria for compensation. The Administration will also propose regulatory changes to RECA to facilitate claims processing.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example is a public announcement made by the Administration and does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Previous and On-going Actions Described in Building Public Trust Include:	"As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer without additional context. However, FOIA exemption 5 generally covers privileged communications, such as those between an agency and its attorneys or those that would be protected by the attorney-client privilege in the private sector. If the ""previous and on-going actions"" described in the document involve such privileged communications, they may be protected under exemption 5. It is ultimately up to the agency to determine whether the exemption applies and to provide a justification for withholding the information if requested under FOIA."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Actions to Improve Openness in Government.     • ACHRE transferred more than 4,000 cubic feet of documents to the National Archives. The Administration has made 300,000 fully searchable pages of documents available on the Internet, and will add an additional 200,000 pages shortly. The Departments of Energy and Defense have published document search guides.     • The President signed Executive Order 12958 directing Federal agencies to review and declassify thousands of documents, including documents on radiation experiments.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it pertains to actions taken to improve openness in government and does not contain any privileged or confidential information.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Actions to Protect human subjects in the future.     • President Clinton established the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) to examine bioethical issues, including human research issues. A subcommittee of NBAC will address certain broad questions raised by ACHRE, including how to strengthen Institutional Review Boards -- the local ethics panels for Federally-sponsored research.     • In October, 1995 President Clinton directed agencies to develop plans to improve their oversight of ethics rules. The agencies have completed their review and upgraded protections, and NBAC will review agency procedures in the coming months.     • Agencies have undertaken nationwide education efforts to raise the profile of ethical considerations, and are funding research to improve our understanding of informed consent.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or the deliberative process privilege. The actions described involve internal agency deliberations and discussions about improving ethical oversight, which could potentially be considered privileged communications. However, it ultimately depends on the specific circumstances and context of the information in question.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Actions to Right Past Wrongs.     • In October, 1995 President Clinton apologized to subjects of radiation experiments and their families on behalf of an earlier generation of American leadersand citizens; former Energy Secretary O'Leary made apologies in certain individual cases.     • The Administration will propose legislation to make veterans treated with nasopharyngeal radiation eligible for health care services under the Veteran's Administration's Ionizing Radiation Program.

D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; WASHINGTON (AP) President Clinton took steps today to protect those who participate in secret, government-sponsored experiments from mistreatment and assure they are fully informed of the risks. The administration also said it has settled the last of a number of claims, totalling $6.5 million, from families of civilians who were injected with plutonium or uranium as part of secret experiments in the 1940s. The actions are• • designed to increase public trust ... and make our government accountable to the American people,"" said Energy Secretary Federico Pena, whose department has spearheaded the public review of past radiation experiments. Pena said the administration also will ask Congress to expand a program that provides compensation to uranium miners who were exposed to radiation as part of the government nuclear weapons program. He said up to 600 additional miners would be compensated at a cost of about $ 50 million. The plans for giving greater protection to research participants were prompted by recommendations more than a year ago by a presidential commission that investigated the government's use of humans in radiation research during the Cold War years. The advisory panel warned that past excesses might be repeated unless there are new safeguards. The White House said today that Clinton had signed a memorandum ,; strengthening the rights and protections afforded individuals who agree to be subjects of secret, government-supported research. The White House said a review by an interagency task force uncovered no government-supported classified human research at this time. But officials acknowledged that formal accounting for such research needs to be improved. Meanwhile, the White House said it had settled claims with four additional families of 1B individuals who were given plutonium injections as part of 1940s experiments. One victim has not been located and the family of another does not want compensation, said Tara O'Toole, DOE's assistant secretary for environment, safety and health. Associate  Attorney  General  John Dwyer  said the 16 claims        12 of which  totalling  $4.B million  were  made  public last November  total $6.5 million. The government has said it is prepared to provide compensation to the families of 52 other individuals who the advisory commission said were believed to be subjected to improper radiation experiments. The identity of those 52 are not known, and so far no families have come forward, according to the White House. Under the new presidential directive on human research, agencies must develop new rules that clearly require scientists to obtain informed consent from all potential subjects of secret experiments. Currently, such consent may be waived under some circumstances. The president also ordered that any research subject be told the identity of the sponsoring agency and whether the experimentation is classified. The new rules also would require the head of the agency to approve such research and develop a more independent review process than currently provided. Also in response to the October 1995 findings by the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, the president said he will: Ask Congress to broaden a 1990 law that allows compensation to underground uranium miners who became ill because of exposure to radiation. Under current law, hundreds of miners are ineligible for compensation. Will propose legislation to make veterans' health care benefits available to airmen and sailors who were subjects of radioactive nasal treatments more than 50 years ago. The treatments were to prevent broken eardrums during flight or in submarines. Will seek broader epidemiological studies to determine the long-term health impact of nuclear bomb testing during the Cold War to military personnel and civilian populations near the test areas.

It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege, work product privilege, or deliberative process privilege. If the Advisory Committee's discussions and deliberations about the universe of experiments studied were considered part of their deliberative process, then this information could be withheld under exemption 5. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances and context of the Advisory Committee's work.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A: The President directed the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) to review government sponsored biomedical experiments on individuals involving intentional exposure to ionizing radiation, focusing on the period from 1944 until 1974. The Committee did not consider common clinical practices that involved incidental exposures to ionizing radiation (e.g. x-rays).	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve privileged communications within or between government agencies.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The President's charge also covered intentional releases of ionizing radiation designed to test human health effects or to measure the extent of human exposure. The Committee studied a number of populations exposed to radiation during the government's Cold War activities, including veterans of atomic test blasts, western uranium miners, and residents of the Marshall Islands.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances of the information and how it was communicated.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q: How many experiments does this include?	No, this question does not pertain to any privileged or confidential communication within the government, and therefore would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A: No one knows exactly how many experiments this includes. The Advisory Committee reported that the government had sponsored several thousand human radiation experiments between 1945 and 1974.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q:How many people were involved in these experiments?	No, this question would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. A simple factual question about the number of people involved in experiments would not fall under this exemption.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A: Because only fragmentary information has survived about many of these experiments it was not possible for the Advisory Committee to estimate how many people were involved.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q:How many people were harmed in the experiments?	It is possible that this question could be protected under FOIA exemption 5 if the information being requested is considered privileged or confidential communication between government officials. However, if the information is already publicly available or does not fall under exemption 5, it may still be subject to release under FOIA. Ultimately, the determination of whether or not the information is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances and context of the request.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A: The Advisory Committee was not in a position to answer this question completely. In general, the Committee found that the majority of experiments they studied involved trace amounts of radiation given to adults, similar to those used in research today. These were unlikely to have caused physical harm. The Committee identified several groups of experiments that may have increased individuals' risks, including total body irradiation experiments on ill patients and iodine-1 31 experiments involving children.	No, this statement does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5. It does not contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of a government agency.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q: How many people were not informed in advance that they were the subject of an experiment?	As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide information. ; ; It is possible that the answer to this question could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and attorney work product. If the information is part of an internal agency discussion or decision-making process, it may be considered deliberative and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, if the information is already public or does not fall under any of the exemptions, it may be subject to release under FOIA. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to release the information would be up to the agency handling the FOIA request.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A: Only very limited documentation about consent in individual experiments has survived and no estimates can be made. Generally, the Committee found that researchers obtained consent from healthy subjects, but not from patient-subjects. The Advisory Committee did look more broadly at issues of informed consent across the government and found that the government did not have comprehensive policies in place before 1974. Although the government has strengthen informed consent procedures significantly since 1974, the Committee recommended -- and the Administration is taking -- additional steps to improve informed consent, including requiring informed consent in all classified research (eliminating a current waiver provision) and studying further the informed consent process.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to pre-decisional or deliberative information. It is a summary of findings and recommendations made by the Advisory Committee.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q: What did the Advisory Committee recommend?	It is possible that this question could be protected under FOIA exemption 5 if the Advisory Committee's recommendation was made as part of a deliberative process, such as internal discussions or debates, and the disclosure of the recommendation would inhibit the free and frank exchange of ideas within the government. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the Advisory Committee's recommendation and the agency's justification for withholding the information.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A: The Committee made 18 recommendations to open the record to the public, compensate those who were wronged, and protect human subjects of future research.	No, this statement does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 generally applies to privileged communications, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement appears to be a summary of recommendations made by a committee, which would not typically fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q: What has the Administration done to respond?	It is possible that this question could be protected under FOIA exemption 5 if it pertains to internal deliberations or communications within the Administration that are considered privileged or confidential. However, without more context it is difficult to determine for certain.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A: The Administration has already taken steps in each of these areas. For example, to open up the record, the Administration has put thousands of pages of documents on the Internet and in the National Archives, and has developed document search guides. To better protect human subjects in the future, the President established the National Bioethics Advisory Committee (NBAC) and asked NBAC to examine many of the questions raised by ACHRE. To redress the wrongs of the past, the President apologized to subjects of radiation experiments and their families, and agencies have worked hard to settle compensation claims. These and many other actions responding to the Committee's recommendations are outlined in the report released today.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of government decision-making.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Today the Administration also announced two new actions -- the President is issuing a directive strengthening protections for subjects of classified research, and the Administration is proposing legislation to improve compensation for uranium miners.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q: Are current protections for subjects of human research inadequate?	It is possible that this question could be protected under FOIA exemption 5 if it is part of an ongoing internal discussion or deliberation within a government agency. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process, and that would not be available to the public if they were requested through FOIA. However, if this question is part of a public report or statement, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A: A strong system of Federal oversight, education, and sanctions is currently in place to ensure the protection of the subjects of government sponsored human research. The Administration has taken a number of steps to further strengthen protections for human subjects based on the Advisory Committee's recommendations. For example, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission is reviewing Institutional Review Board policies -- IRBs are the local boards that review the ethics of individual research projects. And today the President signed a directive to protect subjects of classified research.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain pre-decisional or deliberative information. It is a statement of current policies and actions taken by the Administration.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The Administration is also working to improve the informed consent process. Despite the vigor with which all parties embrace the informed consent process, the Advisory Committee found that little is actually known about the effectiveness of this transaction between researcher and prospective subject. In response, the NIH and the Departments of Energy and Veterans Affairs are initiating research to develop new knowledge about the informed consent process.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication. If the information is part of ongoing research or policy development, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q: Now that the National Bioethics Advisory Commission has been given a special assignment on cloning, does this mean that there will be a delay in addressing protection of human research subjects.	It is possible that this question could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. If the question was part of an internal discussion or decision-making process within the National Bioethics Advisory Commission or another government agency, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under FOIA. However, if the question was asked in a public forum or in a communication that was not considered privileged, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A: No. the National Bioethics Advisory Commission has already established an ambitious plan of work to address the current status of Federal protection for human research subjects. The work will proceed in parallel with the special assignment on cloning. NBAC is planning to issue a report to the President and to Congress in October and hopes that little or no delay will be incurred as a result of the additional work.	No, this statement does not contain any information that would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and certain law enforcement records. This statement simply describes the plans and goals of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission and does not contain any privileged or confidential information.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q: What is being done to provide compensation in connection with the human radiation experiments?	It is possible that this question could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and certain law enforcement records. If the question pertains to ongoing discussions or decisions related to compensation for the human radiation experiments, it may fall under the deliberative process privilege.

Ultimately, the determination of whether the question is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances and context of the request.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A: The Advisory Committee recommended the government compensate or consider compensate subjects of certain biomedical experiments. The Department of Justice has worked closely with other Departments to resolve individual claims. As announced today, the Administration has resolved all claims brought forward for experiments the Advisory Committee specifically identified for compensation. The Administration has settled with families of 16 plutonium injection subjects. The plutonium injection cases were singled out by the Advisory Committee as being particularly troubling ethically and deserving of compensation because efforts were made by the government to keep information secret from the subjects or their families to avoid government liabilities or embarrassment. The Advisory Committee also identified two other experiments for compensation (see Recommendation 1 ), but the subjects of those experiments are unknown.	It is possible that some parts of this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. Specifically, any internal discussions or deliberations within the Advisory Committee or between the Department of Justice and other departments regarding the decision to compensate or consider compensating subjects of certain biomedical experiments could be protected. However, the fact that the Administration has resolved all claims brought forward and settled with families of 16 plutonium injection subjects would likely not be protected under exemption 5, as it is a final decision or action taken by the government. The identification of the two other experiments for compensation may also be protected if it involves internal discussions or deliberations.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Several other experiments were identified by the Advisory Committee for consideration for possible compensation, subject to further development of the facts surrounding the experiments. That fact-finding continues in a number of these cases. [Refer detailed questions to DoJ].	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the experiments being referred to, as well as any ongoing legal or investigative proceedings related to them. Ultimately, a determination of whether this statement is exempt from FOIA disclosure would need to be made by the agency in question or a court of law.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Some populations exposed to radiation releases studied by the Committee are already eligible for compensation under existing law, including atomic vets and uranium miners. The Committee recommended certain changes to these programs. The Administration has reviewed and acted on those recommendations. For example, today we are announcing new legislation to improve compensation for uranium miners.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

The mention of a discussion with the Department of Justice suggests that this communication was part of an internal government deliberation, which would be protected from disclosure under exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; DOJ and I are planning to put a revised proposal into 0MB review on Friday. The new approach quantifies uncertainties in the claims process, and proposes to give the miners the benefit of the doubt in resolving the uncertainties. This approach avoids the precedential issue that DOJ was concerned about, while expanding the number of miners eligible for compensation. (Miners who fall within this approach would still get partial compensation.)	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific context and nature of the communication.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; I am especially glad to see here today Senator Glenn, who's been so active in working on medica1 ethics issue, Congressman Markey, who’s worked  on this  issue  for  a  very long time;. Congressman Frost, Secreta_ry     Shalala, Deputy Secretary. of Veterans Affairs Herschel Goqer, and· of cours·.e, the.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; I want to thank Secretary O'Leary for h r extraordinary devotion to this cause. And you heard in her remarks  basically the way that she views this.  It's a part of her o ngoing         commitment to finish the end of the Cold War. And perhaps no  Energy Secretary as :. ever done· as much as she has to be an advocate, whether it is for continued reforms within the Energy Department or her outspoken endorsement ·of the strongest possible commitment on th:e·  part· of the· United States to a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which I believe we will achieve next year in no small measure thanks to the support  of the Secretary of Energy. ,.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; And all of you who served·on the committee -- I remember the first  time we put this committee together.    I looked -- I said, that's a pretty distinguished outfit.   I wish I could give them five or six jobs to do.    (Laughter.) I'll expect you back next Monday and then we'11 (laughter). I _do thank you so much for the work you have done.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Let me tell you that, just  as      this is an important part of the efforts that Secretary O'Leary outlined, I saw.this committee as. an indispensable part of our effort to restore the confidence of the American people in the integrity of _their government.  All of these political reform issues to me are integrated.  When I became the President, I realized we had great new economic challenges, we had profound social problems, that a lot of these things had to be done by an energized American citizenry, but that our national government_had   role ·to play in moving our country through this period of transition.  And in order to do it, we needed to increase the capacity of the government to do it through political reform, but we also needed, as much as anything else, to increase the confidence of the American people that, at the very least, they could trust the United States government to tell the truth and to do the right things.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government. It is a statement made by a public official regarding their views on political reform and the role of government.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; So you have to understand that, for me, one reason this is so important is that I see it as part of our ongoing effort to give this government back to the American people -- Senator Glenn's long effort to get Congress to apply to itself the same laws it imposes on the private sector; the restrictions that I imposed on members of my administration in high positions for lobbying for foreign governments; and when the lobby bill failed in the Congress, I just imposed it by executive order on members of the Executive Branch.   All these efforts at political reform, it seems to me, are important.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. This statement does not appear to be a communication between government agencies or within a single agency, nor does it appear to be pre-decisional or deliberative in nature.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; But none of these efforts can succeed unless people believe  that     they  can rely  on their       government to  te1l  them the truth and to do the right thing. We have declassified thousands of government documents,  files from second world war, the. Cold War, 0 President Kennedy's assassination.  These   actions are not only consistent with our national security, they are essential to advance our values.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; So, to me, that's what this is all about.   And to all those who represent the families who have been involved in these incidents, let me say to you, I hope you feel that your government has kept its .commitment to the American people to tell the truth and to do the right thing.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any deliberative process or privileged communication within the government.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We discovered soon after I entered office that  with the specter of an atomic war looming like Armageddon far nearer than it ··does· today, the   United States government  actually did  carry out          on our citizens experiments involving radiation.        That's when I ordered the creation of this committee.   Dr. Faden and the others did a superb job.  They enlisted many of our nation's most significant  and important medical and scientific-ethicists.    They had to determine first whether experiments conducted or sponsored by our government between 1944 and 1974 met the ethical and scientific ·standards of that time and of our time.  And' then they had to see to it_that our research today lives up to nothing less than our highest values and our most deeply-held beliefs.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances of the experiments and the committee's work.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; .. From the beginning, it was obvious to me that this energetic committee was prepared  to do its part..  We declassified thousands  of pages of documents.   We gave committee members  the keys to the  government's  doors, file cabinets and-safes.

Exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; What this committee learned I would like to review today with a little more detail than Dr. Faden said, because I think it must be engraved on our _national memory.    Thousands of government-sponsored experiments did take place at hospitals, universities and military bases around our nation. The goal was to understand the effects of radiation exposure on the human body.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

In too many cases, informed consent                  was withheld.  Americans   were kept in the dark about the effects of what was being  done_to them.    The deception extended _beyond the test subjects themselves to encompass their families and i the American people as awhole, for these experiments were kept  ·       .\ secret.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; BACKGROUND: From the 1940s to the 1960s the United States' nuclear weapons program relied on uranium from mines in the Southwestern United States. Miners working in those mines were exposed to levels of radiation known to be dangerous  because the  United States did not ensure that the mines were adequately ventilated. As a result hundreds of miners contracted or will contract fatal lung cancer.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The information provided in the background does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The Radiation Exposure and Compensation  Act of 1990 (RECA)  provides  for compensation of some miners, as well as those living downwind of nuclear test  sites. Uranium  miners qualify for $100,000 compensation if they were exposed to a certain amount of radiation and they contract lung cancer (almost always fatal).	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it is a statute and not a communication between government agencies.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) recommended that the President seek legislation that would ""provide compensation to all miners who develop lung cancer after some minimal duration of employment underground..."" Their  recommendation was based, in part, on the conclusion that the actions of the United States with respect to the miners was egregious. The government knowingly allowed the miners to work under conditions likely to cause fatal cancers and neither warned the miners nor took action to mitigate the danger. See ACHRE Final Report, pages 565-582."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The recommendation made by the ACHRE could be considered a deliberative process, as it involves the committee's internal discussions and decision-making. However, it ultimately depends on the specific circumstances and context of the information in question.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The Inter-Agency Working Group on Human Radiation (IAWG), chaired by DPC staff, has developed proposed legislation to respond to the ACHRE recommendations on RECA. Different aspects of the proposal would address two different populations:	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The mention of proposed legislation and the involvement of a working group chaired by DPC staff suggests that this information may be part of an ongoing deliberative process within the government. However, the specific circumstances and context of the information would need to be evaluated to determine if exemption 5 applies.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     1. Miners for whom the probability is greater  than 50%  that exposure  in the mines caused their disease.  (The calculated  probability  is  population-based and does not account for individual susceptibility.) All agencies in the IAWG support proposing legislation that would affect these miners.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by the deliberative process privilege. The agencies in the IAWG may be discussing the proposed legislation and their internal deliberations could be considered privileged. However, it ultimately depends on the specific circumstances and the agency's justification for withholding the information.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     2. Miners for whom the population analysis suggests that  the  probability  is less than 50% that mining exposure caused the disease. DOJ has expressed concern about proposing legislation that would compensate these miners.	Yes, this could potentially be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The mention of DOJ expressing concern about proposing legislation could be considered a privileged communication. However, it ultimately depends on the specific circumstances and context of the communication.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     1. Miners with a Probability of Causation of Greater than 50%	It is unclear what specific document or information is being referred to in this question. FOIA exemption 5 pertains to certain privileged communications, such as those involving attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. It is unlikely that information about miners with a probability of causation greater than 50% would fall under this exemption. However, other exemptions under FOIA may apply depending on the specific circumstances and information being requested.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The legislative history suggests that Congress intended RECA to provide compensation to uranium miners for whom the probability that their illness was caused by radiation exposure while mining is greater than 50 percent. In. these cases, RECA provides $100,000 in compensation per uranium miner. In practice, RECA does not accomplish this goal because documenting exact exposures is too difficult and because the scientific premises underlying RECA are not accurate. Therefore the current law denies compensation to some miners who clearly should be eligible.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement appears to be a factual statement about the implementation of a law and does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A working group of the Department of Justice and the National Cancer Institute analyzed the current compensation scheme and recommended changes to ensure that miners are eligible for compensation if it is more likely than not (probability  >50%)  that  their  lung cancer  was caused by exposure in the mines. The proposed measures provide new, less  burdensome methods for miners to establish that radiation  caused  their illness.  The measures  also expand the list of compensable diseases, based on new scientific evidence.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific circumstances of the working group's analysis and recommendations. If the information was part of a deliberative process and the agency could demonstrate that disclosure would harm the decision-making process, it may be exempt from disclosure. However, if the information is purely factual and not part of a deliberative process, it may not be exempt. Ultimately, it would be up to the agency to justify any decision to withhold the information under exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; All departments in the IAWG agree that the Administration should propose these changes.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the statement. If the statement was made as part of a deliberative process within the agency, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     2. Miners with a Probability of Causation of Less than 50%	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, as well as certain types of deliberative process materials. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the information.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The AWG has also been considering a proposal to provide  partial  compensation  to miners for whom there is a significant probability that their lung cancer was caused by exposure in the mines, but the probability is less than 50%. DOJ has voiced concerns about this proposal.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of DOJ's concerns suggests that this information may be part of internal deliberations or communications between agencies, which could be considered privileged. However, the specific circumstances and context of the information would need to be evaluated to determine if exemption 5 applies.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; OPTlONS	"As an AI language model, I do not have enough context to determine what ""OPTlONS"" refers to. Please provide more information or context for me to provide an accurate answer."
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Option A:       Propose legislation to provide at least partial compensation ($50,000) to all miners for whom the probability is between 20% and 50% that  their  lung cancer was caused by exposure to radiation in uranium mines. This approach would also include proposing the measures outlined in Section 1, above, for miners with greater than 50% probability.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it is a proposal for legislation and not a communication between government agencies or officials that would qualify for the exemption.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Option B:       Limit the Administration's proposed legislation to compensation of miners with lung cancer for whom it is more probable  than not that  the cancer  was caused by exposure to radiation in uranium mines (i.e. only propose  measures outlined in Section 1 above).	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents. It is a proposed legislative action and would not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; DISCUSSION	As an AI language model, I do not have access to the specific information or context of the discussion in question. However, FOIA exemption 5 generally applies to privileged communications, such as those between an attorney and client or those that would reveal the agency's decision-making process. It is ultimately up to the agency to determine if the information falls under exemption 5 and can be withheld from disclosure under FOIA.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; OPTION A: Expanding compensation to miners should be viewed in the context of the Administration's response to ACHRE more generally. In responding to ACHRE, the Administration's policy has been to be as generous as is reasonable because the government's actions in these cases denied fair protection to individuals, and undermined democratic control over the government. According to ACHRE's chair, Dr. Ruth  Faden, expanded  compensation for uranium miners is one of the most strongly-felt of ACHRE's recommendations.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. The statement appears to be discussing the Administration's policy and decision-making process, which could be considered privileged information. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances and context in which the statement was made.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; ACHRE's recommendation to expand compensation without requiring individualized proof of causation is appropriate because of the egregiousness of the government's conduct, the impact  of the increased cancer rates in these communities and the government's  support for studying the miners without taking reasonable steps to reduce the known risk.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context in which the statement was made and whether it was considered a privileged communication.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Without a change, uranium miners who are not now compensated  under RECA  will continue to be held to a higher standard of causation than others who are compensated under RECA. Under RECA, people living downwind  of certain areas are compensated  ($50,000) if they  get  a radiogenic disease--even though the probability is very low (<10%) that the disease  was caused by the government's action. In addition, because RECA is not currently based on a probabilistic standard, a significant number of uranium miners who fall within the 20%-50% probability range in Option A are already eligible for compensation.  Option  A  would overcome some of these inequities.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The Clinton Administration has, in certain cases, advocated compensation where there is less than a 50% probability that physical  harm  was caused  by  the government's  action.  First, within the last two months, the government has compensated 13 experimental subjects, as recommended by ACHRE, without any causal link to physical disease. Second, the President announced that children of veterans  exposed  to agent orange  will  be compensated  with medical care if they are born with spina bifida. This decision  was tnade despite the extremely low probability of a connection and in the absence of biological plausibility. ·	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication. If the information was part of a privileged discussion or decision-making process within the Clinton Administration, it may be exempt from disclosure. However, if the information was publicly available or not part of a privileged communication, it would not be exempt.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Our current best estimate of the total additional cost of this proposal  combined  with  the changes to RECA that we have already agreed upon is between $13 and $14 million over  the next 20 years. The expected cost of option A is only a fraction of this amount.	No, this statement does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and certain types of work product. This statement does not appear to fall under any of these categories and appears to be a factual statement about estimated costs.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Outside of the DPC staff, this option is strongly supported by DOE. I expect that OSTP will also support this option, and OMB will express a view within the next day or so.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; OPTION B: (A memo from DOJ making a full argument on this point is attached.]	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer without additional context. However, exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) generally protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are predecisional, deliberative, and contain opinions or recommendations. If the memo from the Department of Justice (DOJ) meets these criteria, it may be protected under exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The general rule in litigation should remain that the government will only pay compensation if it is more likely than not that the government's action caused the harm. Any  decision  to expand the government's liability to other cases is setting a bad precedent. The possible result will be further expansion of the government's liability within RECA--possibly to new populations--and the creation of a model that may be used in entirely different circumstances.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not fall under the category of inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; This option is supported by DOJ.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. A statement expressing support for a particular option does not fall under this exemption.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; PUBLIC REACTION: Stuart Udall, former Secretary of the Interior and his clients, mostly Navaho, are likely to react strongly if  the  Administration does not  propose  some compensation for most miners with lung cancer. I expect they will have some success in the New Mexico Congressional Delegation and with the Governor. The decision on this issue, however, is unlikely to affect the overall reception of the Administration's response  to ACHRE.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement appears to be discussing public reaction and political considerations, which would not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; RECOMMENDATION AND NEXT STEPS	As an AI language model, I do not have access to the specific content of the recommendation and next steps. However, FOIA exemption 5 generally applies to privileged communications within or between government agencies, including attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and deliberative process privilege. If the recommendation and next steps fall under any of these categories, they may be protected under exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; I recommend that you support Option A. Whatever your decision, OMB will inform key Departments to determine whether any Department wishes to request a principals meeting to discuss this issue further.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication. If it contains confidential advice or recommendations from a government official, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure.

However, based on the information provided, it is not clear whether the message would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 generally covers privileged communications, such as those involving attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. Without more information about the content of the message, it is not possible to determine whether it would fall under one of these categories.
T0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Attachment	It is impossible to determine whether an attachment would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 without knowing the content of the attachment and the specific circumstances surrounding the request for information. FOIA exemption 5 protects certain types of privileged or confidential information, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials.

T0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; January 3, 1997 Office.of Legislative Affairs SUBJECT:    Proposed Amendments to RECA to Provide Partial Compensation to uranium Miners	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer without additional context. However, based on the information provided, it is possible that the document could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and deliberative process privilege. The document appears to be a communication from the Office of Legislative Affairs regarding proposed amendments to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), which could potentially involve legal or policy advice or deliberations. It would ultimately depend on the specific content and context of the document.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; This responds to your request for the views of the Civil Division on the amendments to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) which would authorize the payment of partial compensation to uranium miners for whom the probability is 50\ or less that their lung cancer was caused by exposure to radiation in the mines.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications and attorney work product. The fact that this is a response from the Civil Division suggests that it involves legal advice or analysis, which would fall under exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; First, we support the other proposed amendments to RECA because we believe they will result in a fairer program for the claimants. We helped to develop many of these proposals based on our experience in administering the program. We have worked hard to improve the administration of the program and are proud of what we have achieved and fully support the bulk of what has been proposed. We feel, however, that we must object to one of the proposals.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government agency.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The current RECA provisions authorize the payment of $100,000 in compensation to miners who demonstrate that they were exposed to defined minimum levels of radiation. The legislative history of RECA indicates that Congress set the minimum exposure levels to approximate the point where, on average, it was more likely than not the miner's exposure caused his lung cancer; i.e., where the probability of causation was greater than 50%.1 RECA also authorizes the payment of compensation in the amount $50,000 to downwinders, persons who demonstrate that they were physically present in certain specified counties or geographic areas in the States of Arizona, Nevada, and Utah  during periods when atmospheric testing was carried out at the Nevada Test Site, and who suffer from certain statutorily specified radiogenic cancers.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or the deliberative process privilege. The legislative history of RECA and the reasoning behind the minimum exposure levels could potentially fall under the deliberative process privilege, which protects pre-decisional communications that are part of the decision-making process. However, it ultimately depends on the specific circumstances and context of the information being requested.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 1  we understand that because the minimum exposure levels currently specified in the statute do not accurately reflect a 50% probability of causation for most miners, the Department has proposed legislation to amend RECA to incorporate new, more accurate criteria. We support these proposals.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. If the statement was made as part of an internal discussion or decision-making process within the Department, it could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, if the statement was made in a public forum or as part of a public comment process, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this statement is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific context in which it was made and the agency's justification for withholding it.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; One of the proposed amendments to RECA would add provisions authorizing the payment of compensation in the amount of $50,000 to uranium miners who demonstrate that they were exposed to levels of radiation in the mines at which the probability is only between 20% and 50% that their lung cancer was caused by exposure to radiation in the mines.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications, deliberations, or documents.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; It is our understanding that the rationale for these proposed amendments is to more nearly equalize the treatment of uranium miners and downwinders. Scientific evidence indicates that downwinders were exposed to much lower levels of radiation and, therefore, a much smaller increased risk of cancer, than were uranium miners. Therefore, the argument goes, it is unfair to allow downwinders whose probability of causation is below 50% to recover compensation while denying such recovery to uranium miners.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the statement. If it was part of an internal agency discussion or deliberation, it may be considered privileged. If it was a public statement or part of a public record, it would not be protected.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We believe this reasoning is flawed. If the current scheme is providing payments to individuals whose illnesses more likely than not were not caused by radiation does not justify expanding payments to other individuals whose illnesses were not likely caused by radiation. We do not believe the case has adequately been made to overcompensate the miners which would be favored by the proposed legislation.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Our main concern is that if this legislation is enacted, it can be anticipated that other groups will seek to be included in a similar way. For example, the geographical limits on the downwinder population will be subject to expansion. The counties and geographic areas currently specified in the statute exclude persons in adjacent counties and geographic areas where they were exposed to comparable levels of radiation from the nuclear testing program., Moreover, the costs of an expanding program are difficult to predict. For instance, the initial assessment of the cost of the Black Lung Program proved to be dramatically low.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D1			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Very importantly, expansion of the precedent for paying individuals compensation for injuries which, more likely than not, were not caused by the events triggering the compensation program is a profound policy decision. We would draw the policy line short of providing recovery for persons who probably were not injured by the government activities involved. The rule in litigation is that those who sue the government for injuries caused by governmental action must prove that the injuries were caused by the governmental action. [This standard is encompassed in 28 use 1346(b)] In many of these cases the plaintiffs may have a sympathetic case but lack the evidence to prove causation by the preponderance standard. Once the precedent is established that in some “exceptionable"" cases the government, although not legally liable, is willing to legislatively compensate claimants, it will be hard to justify denying compensation to one group of citizens having granted it to others."	It is possible that this could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances of the communication.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Moreover, reducing the level of compensation does not derogate from the adverse consequences. The issue remains whether an individual should receive compensation for injuries most likely unrelated to the activities giving rise to the compensation. The bottom line is the same, the government would provide compensation even though most of the claimants receiving compensation would be compensated for injuries unrelated to the government's conduct. We believe the dangers of allowing compensation in these instances will invite many more such requests.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications. FOIA exemption 5 only applies to documents that are pre-decisional, deliberative, and contain opinions or recommendations related to agency decision-making.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Having raised these concerns, we recognize that the decision of whether to bestow a new entitlement on a favored group is a policy call and acknowledge that this proposal will be considered by Congress which can weigh these risks in their consideration of the amendment. In administering many of these compensation programs and in generally defending the government against claims of aggrieved citizens, however, we believe that such an extension should not be proposed by the Administration.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the statement. If it was part of an internal deliberation or communication between agency officials, it may be considered privileged. If it was a public statement or communication with Congress, it would likely not be protected.
D1			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We do not believe it is good public policy because it creates a new standard of compensation for one specific, favored group of citizens, which is not generally available to others whose claims may; in some instances, be equally or even more compelling. By making exceptions to certain favored groups rather than adhering to requirements equally applicable to everyone injured by the government, we will open a process in which groups may obtain relief more on the basis of their political ability than on the basis of an easily understood and accepted ""more likely than not"" standard. Once this policy Rubicon is crossed it will be easier for each successive group to muster its arguments that it is also deserving of a special exception. Ultimately, such deviation from the standard for ""favored"" groups may undermine the public's faith in the government's commitment to treating all of its citizens equally and undermine the public's support of such compensation programs."	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not fall under the category of predecisional or deliberative material. It is a statement of policy and opinion, rather than a communication related to the decision-making process.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The bottom line is we think it is bad policy to pay taxpayer funds for a condition which is not likely caused by government conduct.	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer as to whether the statement would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. However, exemption 5 generally covers privileged communications, such as those between an attorney and client or those that would be protected by the deliberative process privilege.

D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Grady said they're likely to be a ""huge number•· it's with a 'B'; is is a billion-dollar case,"" he said. But others familiar with the federal investigations into yield burning, including regulators and lawyers, contend that Wall Street's liability will be far less, perhaps in the tens of millions of dollars. The lawsuit cites the example of a 1994 Collier County municipal-bond refunding deal as typical of underwriters' practices. The suit alleges that Salomon Smith Barney charged the county too much to complete the transaction. The complaint added that the firm had ""knowingly or recklessly failed to disclose""' to Collier County that it had charged the municipality an excessive mark-up on securities. The lawsuit also said that another firm had improperly certified the mark-up on the deal. A Salomon Smith Barney spokeswoman couldn't provide immediate comment on the lawsuit. Other firms named in the lawsuit, such as Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Goldman Sachs, La=d and Lehman Brothers, declined to comment. In another yield-burning lawsuit, the City of New Orleans has sued Smith Barney and BT Alex. Brown Inc., a subsidiary of Bankers Trust Corp. over alleged yield burning. In September, La=d Freres paid about $9 million to settle a yield-burning lawsuit brought by a Los Angeles County agency."

Reilly Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal NEW YORK - Golden Books Family Entertainment, the struggling children's book publisher, was dealt another blow as its president and second-in-<:ommand, Eric Ellenbogen, resigned unexpectedly to take a job as president and chief executive officer of Marvel Enterprises Inc. Mr. Ellenbogen, 41 years old, came to the company in 1996 as president of its entertainment group, a television and video-based unit. In June, he was named president of the entire company, acting as No. 2 to Richard E. Snyder, the parent's 65-year-old chairman and chief executive. At Marvel, he succeeds Joseph Ahearn, who previously said he would resign as soon as a successor was named. Marvel Enterprises was created in October when Marvel Entertainment Group Inc. emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and merged with Toy Biz Inc. It owns the rights to several comic-book characters including ""Spidennan,"" 11X-Men"" and ""Men in Black,"" as well as Fleer/Skybox, a trading-card maker, and the Panini stickers business. Mr. Ellenbogen was credited with building Broadway Video, a television production and distribution company, which Golden Books acquired in 1996. He directed Broadway's acquisition of crucial film and television libraries, including titles such as ""Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" and ""Lassie."" The company said Mr. Snyder now will directly oversee the entertainment unit, which includes home video, merchandising and licensing. Golden Books' nine-month net loss widened sharply to $70.3 million, or $2.77 a share, and revenue fell to $142 million from $ f70 million. It recently reached a preliminary standstill agreement with a group of bondholders to put off interest payments on $100 million in debt. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Golden Books said there is ""substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern."" The company has warned that possible ""restructuring, reduction of costs and other actions"" could result in substantial year-end charges. Earlier this month, it was notified by the Nasdaq Stock Market about the possible delisting of the company's stock for failure to maintain a closing price of at least $5. The shares could be delisted . as early as Dec. 11, though the company says it plans to ""work with the Nasdaq"" to ensure its continued listing. Shares of Golden Books fell 6.25 cents to 43.75 cents in Nasdaq trading, close to a 52-week low. Marvel rose 6.25 cents to $5.9375 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.

D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Credit Markets: With Market Turmoil in the Rearview Mirror, Corporations Drive Forward With Bond Issues By Catherine Valenti and Tom Sullivan Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal Corporations of all stripes rushed to raise money in the bond market, including issuers who just six weeks ago wouldn't have stood a chance of raising funds.   As confidence  continued after the recent financial turmoil, problem-plagued ftanchis marketing company Cendant Corp. sold $1.55 billion ofbon increasing the size from a planned $500 million in response t strong investor demand. In addition, two telecommunications companies sold junk-rated securities to finance the construction new networks. Level 3 Communications Inc., which is using Internet technology, came to market with $500 million of zero-coupon bonds, while Global Crossing Holdings Ltd. sold $500 million of preferred stock to help finance its international fiber-optic links. Despite the rush, there is little sign the current flood of bond issuance will ease. It emerged yesterday that the Seagram Co. is lining up a giant debt offering, likely to come to market in December. Lead manager Goldman, Sachs & Co. is marketing the deal at a size of $2 billion. But there is widespread expectation among people looking at the transaction that the total could be raised to $2.5 billion to $4 billion. Goldman declined to comment on whether the size would be increased. No official confirmation of the use of proceeds was available. However Montreal-based Seagram is completing its acquisition of entertainment company PolyGrarn NV. The acquisition is valued in excess of$10 billion and is expected  to close  Dec. 4. With issuance rapidly making up any ground lost in September and early October, worries about a credit crunch are easing, though some participants say the real test will come after Thanksgiving with Seagram's deal and the $2.5 billion anticipated from Monsanto Co., announced two weeks ago. ""The supply overhang that we saw all year is coming to the market and deals are getting done,"" said Greg Hahn, senior vice president and fixed-income portfolio manager at Conseco Capital Management. ""That's a very healthy sign for the market  right now."" The key to Cendant's deal was the high yield on offer, according to investors. That helped to overcome worries about the accounting scandal that has plagued the company this year. ""Obviously  the company has had its accounting problems, but you can't  beat"" the yield on offer relative to Treasurys, said John Kowalik, senior vice president and portfolio manager at Oppenheimer Funds. ""If you're a yield  buyer, this would qualify as a candidate."" Lead underwriters Chase Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co. said that even at the increased size, demand outstripped  the bonds available.   The company so/d $400 million of two-year notes at a yield 2.875 percentage points more than comparable Treasurys and $1.15 billion of five-year notes at a yield 3.125 percentage points more than Treasurys.    During the four-day roadshow to market the bond deal, syndicate officials said Cendant focused on the strength of its core businesses and strategy. For much of this year, the company's public image has been beset by an accounting scandal that took place at direct marketer CUC International, which merged with HFS Inc. to form Cendant in late 1997. As a further enticement, Cendant  will increase the coupon on the bond deal by 1.5 percentage points if its ratings are downgraded to junk status by both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's. Currently it is rated Baal by Moody's and triple-B by S&P. In the junk market, Global Crossing's offering of senior exchangeable pay-in-kind preferred securities was doubled from its originally planned size. The securities were priced at par with a 10.5% dividend rate. Level 3's deal was its second offering this year. It sold $3 billion of junk bonds in April and these securities have become a market favorite. During the financial crisis of mid-August to mid-October, ""Level 3 became the only bond you could sell because it was a high-yield benchmark,"" said Jerry Paul, high-yield fund manager Invesco Funds Group, ""and it was knocked down unduly."" Level 3, which has a $10 billion capital plan, ""saw a nice window to get some funds and got the money,"" said one person familiar with the deal. Neither Level 3 officials nor lead underwriter Salomon Smith Barney would comment. Here are the details of yesterday's two-year note auction.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION The proposed legislation would give DOJ three new tools to combat the failure of nursing homes and other residential health care facilities to treat residents properly. First, it creates criminal sanctions for organizations or individuals who knowingly and willfully engage  in a pattern of  physical  or mental harm to residents. Second, it would create civil penalties that could be imposed on individuals, facility chains, or management companies if they engage in conduct that results in a pattern of  physical  or mental harm to residents. Third,  it would authorize  DOJ to seek injunctive  relief  against these entities or individuals whenever DOJ has reason to suspect  that  they are engaging  in behavior  that  will  result in harm to physical or mental harm to residents. DOJ would have to consult  with HHS before invoking  its injunctive authority.	It is possible that some portions of this document could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, this would depend on the specific context and content of the document, as well as any applicable case law or agency policies. Without more information, it is difficult to determine definitively whether exemption 5 would apply.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; OUTSTANDING ISSUES HHS is primarily concerned about the overlap in enforcement  authority  that these  new provisions would create. As currently drafted, the only area of facility noncompliance that would not pose the problem of overlapping authority for both agencies would be those cases where violations are minimal  or where the harm to residents is isolated. HHS is concerned  that  in situations  where both agencies have an interest in initiating an enforcement action, DOJ will push HCFA to delay its enforcement action, since DOJ's need  to build a solid case for conviction  may not coincide  with  HCFA's  need to act swiftly when needed. In addition, HHS is concerned that  DOJ  will develop  its own quality standards for individual facilities and chains when deciding whether to initiate prosecution, thus requiring facilities to comply with one set of standards developed by HCFA  and another  set of standards developed by DOJ.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications and deliberative process privilege. The concerns expressed by HHS about overlapping enforcement authority and potential conflicts between HCFA and DOJ could be considered part of the agencies' deliberative process and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, the specific application of exemption 5 would depend on the specific circumstances and context of the information in question.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; DOJ feels that the overlap in enforcement authority is limited to enforcement action in individual facilities. Currently, no one has the authority to prosecute nursing home chains for repeated violations, which this statute would provide to DOJ. In addition, this policy would not preclude  HHS from taking any action to protect the health and safety of residents, and DOJ is willing to codify this in an MOU.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents. It is a statement about the DOJ's interpretation of a statute and their willingness to work with HHS to protect the health and safety of nursing home residents.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; PROPOSED DPC POSITION Modify the DOJ proposal to limit their new enforcement authority to criminal violations and require HHS to propose new legislation providing the111 with new authority to impose civil penalties. Under this option, the Department of Justice would be allowed to impose new criminal penalties on individuals, facility chains, and management companites who knowingly and willfully engage in a patterns of physical or mental harm to residents. HHS would propose new  legislation creating civil penalties that could be imposed on individuals,  facility chains, or management  companies if they engage in conduct that results in a pattern of physical or mental harm to residents. This compromise provides virtually the same level of enforcement and eliminates the problematic overlap of authority created by the DOJ proposal.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the creation and dissemination of this proposed position.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Inclusion in Crime Bill. As a matter of perception, we believe there is a danger in housing a nursing home quality provision  jn the  crime bill.  Nursing home resident advocates have raised concerns that nursing home enforcement should, in general, be a quality issue, not a crime issue. We recommend pulling the nursing home provision out of the crime bill end sending it up es a stand-alone bill.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government. It is a recommendation and a matter of perception, not a policy decision or legal analysis.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Criminal Authority for DOJ. We concur with the provisions in the bill that would give OQJ criminal authority over both nursing home chains and individual nursing homes.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

This statement appears to be a policy position and does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Referral. The bill would give DOJ the authority to pursue nursing homes without referral from HCFA. We believe this would create significant overlap between HCFA's and DOJ's enforcement . actions and could impede HCFA's actions to improve quality. We are also concerned  that, because  DOJ would exercise its authority through its US Attorney's offices, there would not be a consistent application of quality standards. We recommend that DOJ have the authority to pursue nursing homes only upon referral from HCFA or with the explicit approval of HCFA.    We be/,eve them proWsions should be mcluded as part of the actual bill, rather than as an MOU.	It is possible that this could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. The language suggests that the authors are discussing potential concerns and recommendations for the bill, rather than making a final decision or taking action. However, the specific circumstances and context of the communication would need to be evaluated to determine if exemption 5 applies.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Chains vs. Individual Facilities. The bill would give DOJ civil authority to pursue both nursing home chains and individual facilities. We believe HCFA should have primary civil authority in cases involving individual facilities, and we recommend that ives DOJ civil aut onty over individual facilities.  DOJ would continue to have civil authority through the False Claims Act, upon referral from HCFA. DOJ's  proposal  would impede HCFA's ability  to en'fori:e quality through CMPs, including the use of HCFA's new CMP per-instance CMP authority. For nursing home chains, we believe DOJ should have civil authority to pursue nursing home chains only upon referral from HCFA or with the explicit approval of HCFA.

There are approximately 1.6 million older Americans and people with disabilities that receive care in roughly 16,700 nursing homes nationwide. Problems like the inappropriate use of physical restraints and a shortage of hearing aids for those in need were reduced by the enactment of new regulations by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) in 1995. However, HCFA's ongoing review of nursing home care, and a report being sent to Congress today by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), shows that tougher enforcement is needed to ensure high quality care in an nursing homes.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;         II. BACKGROUND There are approximately 16,800 nursing homes in the United States, serving 1.6 million people. Since HCFA put new regulations in place in 1995, the health and safety of nursing homes has improved. But Senator Grassley will unveil a report next week on the shortcomings in nursing home care, and HCFA will transmit a report to Congress tomorrow concluding that tougher enforcement is needed to ensure high quality in all nursing homes. You will respond to both of these reports with a tough new initiative to crack down on bad apple nursing homes and ensure high quality care.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents. It is a statement about a report and a proposed initiative.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; New Legislation to Improve the Quality of Nursing Homes. You will announce that you are transmitting legislation to the Hill this week that calls for:	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any inter-agency or intra-agency communication or document. It is a public announcement of new legislation being transmitted to the Hill.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;             ▪ New Criminal Background Checks. An important way to improve the quality of nursing homes is to prevent inadequate personnel from entering the system in the first place. The legislation you will propose would require nursing homes to conduct criminal background checks on all potential personnel.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents. It is a proposed legislation and not a communication or document created within a government agency.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;             ▪ National Abuse Registry. Once inadequate personnel have been identified, they should be kept out of the system. The new legislation will ask Congress to establish a national registry of nursing home employees convicted of abusing residents.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The creation of a national abuse registry for nursing home employees would not fall under this exemption.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;             ▪ Nutrition and Hydration Therapy. Currently, too few nursing home staff are available to help feed residents. To improve nutrition in nursing homes, you will ask Congress to allow more categories of nursing home employees to perform crucial nutrition and hydration functions.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;                 • Reauthorization of the ursing Home Ombudsman Program. You also will call on Congress to reauthorize the nursing home ombudsman program run by the Administration on Aging, which provides consumers with critical information on poor-quality nursing homes, including records of abuse and neglect.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents. It is a call to Congress to reauthorize a program and provide information to consumers.

The announcement of new administrative actions does not fall under this category.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • Immediate Civil Monetary Penalties in Nursing Homes That Violate Federal Standards. To crack down on inadequate providers, HCFA will direct enforcement authorities to impose civil monetary penalties immediately upon finding a serious or chronic violation. Under current practice, enforcement officials often give nursing homes a second chance to come into compliance, rather than impose immediate sanctions.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. However, it would depend on the specific circumstances and context in which this information was created and communicated.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Staggering survey times: The report that HCFA is transmitting to Congress finds that nursing home inspeciions are too predictable, allowing inadequate homes to prepare for inspections. Enforcement officials will now stagger survey times and conduct some surveys on weekends and evenings.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the statement is not a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it contain privileged or confidential information.

No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Increasing criminal investigations: HCFA also will work with the HHS Office of Inspector General and Department of Justice to refer egregious violations of quality of care standards for criminal investigation and prosecution when appropriate.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided does not fall under this category and would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • Stronger Federal Oversight of State Inspections. HCFA will increase its oversight of state surveyors, review and monitor nursing homes with greater consistency, and take new tough actions against those states that are failing to adequately enforce standards. It will:	No, this statement does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement appears to be a policy announcement or directive, rather than a communication between government agencies or officials.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Terminate Federal nursing home inspection funding to states with continual poor records. The report being released by HCFA finds that some states have cited few or no nursing homes for substandard care. In states where oversight is clearly inadequate, HCFA will terminate state contracts and contract with other entities to conduct Federally-approved inspections.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents. It is a policy decision and action taken by HCFA.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Increase oversigpt of state inspections. HCFA will increase its review of the surveys conducted by the states to ensure thorough oversight, as well as provide additional training and other assistance to state-enforcement officials.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents. It is a statement of policy and action taken by a government agency.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Ensure that nursing homes are in compliance with standards before lifting sanctions. HCFA will increase oversight of state enforcement officials to ensure that they will not lift sanctions until after an on-site visit has verified compliance.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation and dissemination of this information.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • Preventing Bed Sores, Dehydration, and Malnutrition. HCFA will implement new oversight to ensure that nursing homes take actions to prevent bed sores, dehydration, and malnutrition. State surveyors will be required to monitor these activities, and sanction nursing homes with patterns of violations. HCFA also will work with the Administration on Aging, the American Dieticians Association, clinicians, consumers, and nursing homes to develop best practice guidelines to prevent malnutrition and dehydration.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications, such as those between an agency and its attorneys or those that would reveal the agency's decision-making process.

However, it would depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation and dissemination of the survey results, and whether any of the aforementioned privileges apply.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • Implementing New Efforts to Measure and Monitor Nursing Home Quality. In June 1998, HCFA began collecting information on resident care through a national automated data system, known as Minimum Data Sets. This information will be analyzed to identify potential areas of inadequate care in nursing homes and to assess performance in critical areas, such as nutrition, avoidable bed sores, loss of mobility, and use ofrestraints. This assessment will help HCFA and state surveyors to identify nursing homes for immediate on-site inspections and to detect and correct problems earlier.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. However, it would depend on the specific context and content of the information. If the information contains legal advice or internal deliberations about policy decisions, it may be protected.

However, it would depend on the specific context and content of the briefing. If the briefing contained sensitive or confidential information related to government decision-making, it may be exempt from disclosure. If the briefing was simply a routine meeting with stakeholders, it may not be exempt. Ultimately, the decision of whether to release the information would be up to the agency handling the FOIA request.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;         IV. PRESS PLAN Pool Press.

REMARKS Remarks Provided by Speechwriting	It is possible that the remarks provided by speechwriting could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the remarks contain confidential advice or opinions related to the agency's decision-making process, they may be exempt from disclosure. However, if the remarks are purely factual or do not contain privileged information, they may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether the remarks are exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific content and context of the information.
T0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; October 3, 1997 MEMORANDUM TO THE CHIEF OF STAFF cc: FROM: RE: Sylvia Matthews, John Podesta, Bruce Reed, Gene Sperling, Frank Raines, Rahm Emanuel, John Hilley, Mickey Ibarra, Jack Lew, and Josh Gotbaum Chris Jennings NEW YORK AND THE PROVIDER TAX ISSUE	It is possible that this memorandum could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications such as attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and certain inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda. However, without more information about the content and context of the memorandum, it is difficult to determine definitively whether it would be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; On Monday, we (DPC, 0MB and HHS) will brief you on the status of our Medicaid provider tax enforcement plans for New York and other states who may be out of compliance with current law and regulations.  As you well know, this issue is extremely controversial.  Therefore, it is critically important that we have Administration-wide agreement and understanding on how we will announce our position on outstanding provider taxes and on how we will subsequently negotiate with affected states. This memo provides you with background information to help prepare you for the Monday briefing.	It is possible that this memo could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific nature of the information contained in the memo and whether it meets the criteria for exemption 5.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; BACKGROUND Financing scheme. During the late 1980s, many states established financing schemes that had the effect of increasing their Federal Medicaid funds without using additional state resources. Typically, states would raise funds from health care providers (through provider taxes or ""donations""), then pay back those providers through increased Medicaid payments. Since the Federal government pays at least half of Medicaid payments, the provider taxes or donations would be repaid in large part by Federal matching payments. Using this mechanism, the state was left with a net gain because it only had to repay part of the provider tax or donation it originally received.  This led to an unprecedented drain on the Federal Treasury - the major reason why Federal Medicaid costs more than doubled between 1988 and 1992."	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the background does not fall under this category.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The law and regulatory interpretation of the law. Because provider taxes and donations were effectively siphoning off potentially billions of dollars from the Federal Treasury, the Congress limited states' use of these schemes in a bill enacted by President Bush in 1991.  It is important to note that the subsequent regulatory interpretation of these limits -- the very regulations that we are now planning to enforce -- was negotiated with the states and the National Governors' Association in 1993.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those related to legal advice or regulatory interpretation.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; States' continued reliance on impermissible provider taxes and our enforcement record. Despite the new law and the regulations, many states continued to use provider taxes that at least appeared to be out of compliance. To date, these possibly impermissible taxes total an estimated $2 to 4 billion and, in the future, will cost billions more. In response, HCFA issued letters and discussed its concerns about certain taxes with states, but -- for a variety of reasons -- never took any final action (called a ""disallowance""). Unfortunately, this has meant that a number of states have continued using these taxes, believing that HCFA might never enforce the law, or that if they did, they could seek recourse through the White House or the Congress. (In fact, since we do not have a good track record on enforcement, budget examiners at CBO and in the Administration have already written off Federal revenue raised through these provider taxes; this is important to know since it means we could waive past ""abuses"" retrospectively and it might not be scored as a cost.)"	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and content of the letters and discussions between HCFA and the states regarding the provider taxes. If they contain legal advice or deliberative process information, they may be exempt from disclosure.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The New York provision in the balanced budget. To ensure that New York would never be vulnerable to Medicaid provider tax enforcement actions, Senator Moynihan and Senator D' Amato successfully added a provision to the Balanced Budget Act to exempt all of its provider taxes (it has dozens), both retrospectively and prospectively, from disallowances. Both in writing and orally we repeatedly objected to this provision. Moreover, we provided alternative statutory language that would have addressed about two-thirds (over $ I billion worth) of the problem. As you know, however, the Senators (through their staff) rejected our offer and insisted on their original provisions.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The language used in the passage suggests that there may have been internal discussions or negotiations between government officials regarding the provision, which could potentially fall under the deliberative process privilege. However, whether or not this information would actually be exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances and the agency's justification for withholding it.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Line-item veto and New York's reaction. In announcing the line-item veto on August 11, we raised concerns about the cost and ramifications of singling out as permissible one state's provider taxes. Although our actions were generally viewed as responsible and defensible by those who know the program and/or who are budget experts, the same clearly cannot be said of New York's political establishment. The Governor's office, the New York Congressional delegation, the Mayor, providers and unions reacted strongly and negatively to the veto.  Among a host of complaints, they charged that they were singled out and were never made aware that this provision could be subject to the line item veto. Most recently they have criticized us for our . delay in getting back to them and our willingness to support fixes for the other two vetoed provisions without addressing their problem.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to predecisional or deliberative communications within an agency. It is a description of events and reactions to a decision that has already been made.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Review of provider taxes in New York and other states. In August, we began a review of the options to address provider taxes in New York and other states. At the time, we well knew that this action would force us to finally attempt to move to enforce laws against provider taxes in all 36 states that may be out of compliance. We also knew that we had to take this position to support our justification for the line-item veto that no individual state be singled out for special treatment.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication. If the review and decision-making process involved legal advice or deliberations, it may be considered privileged. Ultimately, it would be up to the agency to determine whether or not to release the information in response to a FOIA request.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Wednesday's actions. We believe that our discussion with New York next Wednesday about their provider tax status necessitates that we concurrently release similar information to every other potentially affected state. Three types of actions resulting from this comprehensive review will be announced. First, HCFA will clarify its interpretation of the law and correct the regulation affecting one of the largest New York provider taxes. These policy  clarifications will provide relief to JO states, the largest amount (over $1 billion) going to New York. •	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the discussion with New York and the other potentially affected states. If the information is deemed privileged and exempt from disclosure, the agency would need to provide a justification for withholding it under exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Second, HCFA will issue letters to 9 other states notifying them that one or several of their taxes may be impermissible. Two more states, New York and Louisiana, will also receive this news, but it will be in a letter that also provides some good news about other provider taxes in their states. HCFA will immediately contact these states to begin discussions. The letters do not contain final decisions nor are they legally binding; however, they tell these states that, without further information, HCFA could conduct an audit.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and content of the letters and whether they contain information that is considered privileged or confidential. It is ultimately up to the agency to determine whether they believe the information should be withheld under this exemption.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Third, HCFA will ask another 17 states for more information on one or more of their provider taxes, to assess if they are permissible. (Nine other states who are in one of the top two categories will get similar requests.) For these states, we simply do not have sufficient information to determine the legality of at least some of their taxes.  As we discuss this issue with these states, however, we will also make certain they are aware that they may be eligible for waivers that make their taxes permissible and/or that the provision of additional information may well clarify the legality of their taxes. [NOTE: All states affected are listed in the attached document; dollar amounts are not listed because we will not know them until/unless the states are audited.]	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication. If the information is deemed to be pre-decisional or deliberative, it may be exempt from disclosure.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Discussions and negotiations. The follow up to these letters will be, we hope, immediate discussions between HCFA and the states. Our primary goal is to protect the Federal Treasury prospectively. We may have to trade getting only a fraction of the retrospective disallowed taxes in return for expeditious agreements to prevent future use of impermissible taxes. However, the Department of Justice, which must approve all settlements, has not yet decided how it will evaluate these settlements. This information is crucial to HCFA's ability to negotiate with states in good faith.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The discussions and negotiations between HCFA and the states would likely be considered privileged and confidential, and therefore exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D1			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Implications. Very few of the states who receive notices will be pleased. For example, although HCFA is relieving approximately two-thirds of New York's past impermissible tax claims (worth over $1 billion), there is still at least $500 million in taxes that HCFA probably cannot consider legal. The New York delegation has already put us on notice that nothing less than a ""hold harmless"" solution is acceptable. They define this as meaning that they want us to waive all current taxes both retrospectively and prospectively; in other words, they want the provisions we line-item vetoed."

I'm still stuck  on the problem that we shouldn't  get into the business  of mandating coverage one body part at a time, but I do agree that it is a bit different since this bill would only put it on the same footing as other prescription drugs.

He also announced that the Republican Chair of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Jim Jeffords, and the Public Health and Safety Subcommittee Chair, Senator and Doctor Bill Frist, have indicated their support for passing a bipartisan bill that is consistent with the goals and general recommendations of the HHS report.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the communication.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The Progress and Promise of Genetic Testing. Genetic testing has the potential to identify hidden genetic disorders and spur early treatment. Tests for genetic predisposition to certain diseases and conditions -- such as Huntington's disease and certain types of breast cancer -- are already available and more genetic tests are on the horizon.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or deliberations.

But genetic testing also can be used by insurance companies and others to discriminate and stigmatize groups of people. Studies have shown that:	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement about genetic discrimination is not related to government communications or documents.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • Over one-fifth of people in families where someone has a genetic disorder report that they, or a member of their family, had been discriminated against by an insurance plan.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications. FOIA exemption 5 applies to materials that are normally privileged in the civil discovery process, such as attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and deliberative process privilege.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • 85 percent of Americans report that they are extremely concerned with the possibility that their genetic makeup will be used to discriminate against them or a member of their family.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any privileged or confidential communication within the government.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Building on Kassebaum-Kennedy. Kassebaum-Kennedy took steps to prohibit genetic discrimination by preventing insurers from using genetic information as a ""pre-existing condition"" and denying or limiting coverage in group markets. However, Kassebaum-Kennedy falls short in three areas. It does not:(!) prevent health plans in the individual market from denying coverage on the basis of genetic information; (2) assure that premiums settings are in no way based on genetic information both in the group and individual market; and (3) prevent health plans from disclosing genetic information to insurers, to plan sponsors, and other entities regulated by state insurance laws, such as life, disability, and long-term care insurers."	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to privileged communications within or between government agencies.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; State laws are insufficient. Nineteen states have already enacted laws to restrict the use of genetic information in health insurance and many others have introduced legislation. However, state legislation is insufficient to solve this problem. First, private sector employer sponsored health plans, which cover half of all Americans, are exempt from state insurance laws due to ERISA preemption. Second, current state laws generally focus on genetic tests rather than a broader definition of genetic information such as family history, medical records, and physical exams. Finally, the variability among state bills will lead to a lack of uniformity across the nation as to whether and how genetic information may be used by health plans.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Building on the existing bipartisan commitment to the President's challenge. Several bills have been introduced in this Congress which prohibits health plans from requesting or using genetic information to deny health care coverage or raise premiums. The bipartisan legislation introduced by Rep. Louise Slaughter, H.R. 306, addresses the three major gaps left by the HIPAA legislation and represents a strong foundation for this much-needed reform. It has already attracted over 150 cosponsors. The HHS report released today recommends building on this legislation and enacting a bill that protects all Americans from the threat of genetic discrimination.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of government decision-making.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; POTENTIAL GENETIC SCREENING EVENTS.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege, work product privilege, and deliberative process privilege. If the information relates to ongoing discussions or planning within a government agency regarding potential genetic screening events, it may be considered part of the agency's deliberative process and therefore exempt from disclosure under exemption 5. However, if the information has already been finalized and is not part of any ongoing deliberations, it may not be protected under exemption 5 and could be subject to disclosure under FOIA. Ultimately, the determination of whether this information is exempt from disclosure under FOIA would depend on the specific circumstances and context in which it was created and maintained.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Event with The Genome Action Plan. The Genome Action Plan, which consists of nearly one hundred groups -- including AARP, National Organization of Rare Disorders, National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, Parkinson's Disease Foundation, and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and the March of Dimes -- is willing to design an event with us in order to highlight our report and support legislation on genetic discrimination. They are proposing an event that would take place at the National Academy of Sciences, which would include remarks by a few of their members and a couple of victims of genetic discrimination and the President or Vice President. NAS holds about 600 people. If we want a specific event for this, they are willing to design it as a legislative conference -- which would be appropriate since they too are about ready to announce their support of the Slaughter legislation.	It is possible that some portions of this event could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. However, it would depend on the specific content of any communications or documents related to the event that were being requested under FOIA. The involvement of non-governmental groups like the Genome Action Plan may also complicate the analysis of whether exemption 5 applies.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Event in conjunction with announcement on new gene discovery. Apparently, there is a new gene discovery on a well-known late adulthood disease that is potentially being announced in the next month in Science magazine. Science has not decided when they will publish this gene, although there is fairly good chance they will publish it in late June or early July:  They will be able to notify us between two and three weeks before publication. When they do publish, the Human Genome Institute plans to do a press conference on the discovery. This event -- could highlight the discovery and then emphasize that as we make these new breakthroughs on genetics, we should enact legislation to ensure that this genetic information is not used to discriminate against people. (Even if we do not want to use this to highlight the genetic screening legislation, we may want to consider some possible POTUS involvement). This event is not necessarily mutually exclusive from the event with the Genome Action Plan.	It is unclear whether this event would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as the information provided does not appear to fall under any of the specific categories of privileged or confidential information listed under the exemption. However, it is possible that certain aspects of the event, such as internal communications or deliberations related to the planning and execution of the event, could be protected under exemption 5 if they meet the criteria for attorney-client privilege, deliberative process privilege, or other recognized privileges.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Event with the Society of the Advancement of Women's Research. This group is holding their annual awards event on June 24th, where they will give awards in the areas such as basic research, clinical research, and public policy. We could issue our report and announce our support for genetic screening legislation at that event. This event would obviously emphasize women's concerns about genetic screening in breast cancer.	It is possible that some of the information related to the event, such as the guest list or internal communications about the report and support for legislation, could be protected under FOIA exemption 5 if it falls under the category of privileged communications or deliberative process privilege. However, the event itself and any public announcements made at the event would not be protected under exemption 5.

Justice and Treasury have agreed, as a result, to resume discussions, under ONDCP leadership, on the outstanding issues, with a view to formulating recommendations to the President. NSC, along with other interested agencies and While House elements will be included in these discussions.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; You will recall that Barry agreed, at the conclusion of his meeting with Dick Clarke and me, to move any issues he could not resolve directly with Justice and Treasury into a joint ONDCP/NSC led process before asking the President to decide upon any disputed recommendations. This does not appear necessary for the present, but both Justice and Treasury are aware that this possibility remains open to them if they again lose confidence in ONDCP's handling of the matter.	It is possible that this could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication, as well as any applicable case law or legal precedent.

T0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; INFORMATION  MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT FROM:   SAMUEL BERGER CHARLES RUFF BRUCE REED SUBJECT:    Shaping a Southwest Border Strategy	Yes, this could potentially be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The memorandum was written by high-level officials and contains advice and recommendations for the President, which could be considered privileged information. However, the specific circumstances of the memorandum and the reasons for its classification would need to be evaluated to determine if exemption 5 applies.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Barry Mccaffrey has sent you the attached memorandum regarding his proposal to organize drug control efforts along the Southwest border.    Barry has narrowed his original concept to focus specifically on controlling illegal narcotics that cross the border, rather than casting a wider net covering a broader range of border activities.    He calls for greater coordination among Customs, the Border Patrol and other relevant agencies to address the flow of drugs and urges you designate a single federal official responsible for all counterdrug efforts along the border. He also recommends we develop and deploy advanced technologies to increase detection rates of drug contraband while facilitating legitimate traffic.    Barry has gone ahead and announced that he plans to forward these proposals to you in the coming weeks.	It is possible that this memorandum could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. However, it would depend on the specific nature of the communication and whether it meets the criteria for exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We are sympathetic toward the basic thrust of Barry's proposal for strengthened border coordination.    Justice and Treasury, however, are not yet on board, and are very unhappy with Barry's method of advancement.   Barry will be meeting with Janet Reno and Bob Rubin before October 1 to try to bridge the gap.  Barry has agreed to seek Sandy's help in coordinating a decision package to you, following his meeting with Reno and Rubin, addressing all ·unresolved issues and reflecting all interested agency viewpoints.	It is possible that this could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. The language used suggests that there is ongoing discussion and negotiation between different agencies, and that the communication is part of that process.

About 60 percent of the cocaine entering the U.S. does so across this border, yet seizures in the border region are declining. Total 1998 cocaine seizures are projected to be less than half of the annual average seized between 1991 and 1996 and account for just a fifth of the cocaine crossing the border. Heroin seizures have declined by about a third since 1996. Over the past several years, the general trend has been one of fewer seizures of all drugs except marijuana.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • Drug smugglers coordinate their efforts. Anecdotal evidence and seizure data in El Paso reveals that when met with resistance smugglers simply shift their methods and routes at the ports of entry (POEs) and between the POEs.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and source of the information. If the information was obtained through confidential law enforcement sources or intelligence gathering methods, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. If the information was obtained through publicly available sources or routine reporting, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the decision to withhold or release the information would be up to the agency in question and subject to review by the courts.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • One agency's success will inadvertently and directly impact other agencies.

If a Border Patrol officer needs immediate assistance from a member of US Customs, he would have to radio his communications center which would then contact US Customs communications by telephone. US Customs communications would then radio their personnel to assist the Border Patrol officer. This time consuming process puts agents at risk.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

The fourth goal of your 1998 National Drug Control Strategy is to ""Shield America's air, land, and sea frontier from the drug threat."" Over the past five years, your Administration has invested heavily in anti-drug programs to secure the two-thousand mile border with Mexico. As a result, Customs' budget for Southwest Border programs has increased 72 percent since FY93. The number of assigned DEA special agents has increased 37 percent while the number of assigned INS agents has almost doubled. Toe enclosed ONDCP White Paper suggests how better coordination can dramaticaly improve the effectiveness of our collective efforts. We look forward to submitting a detailed proposal for your consideration this fall."

For the last three years, the many federal agencies involved in law enforcement, commerce and transportation along our border have been engaged in a process to determine how we can best fulfill these anti-drug imperatives. The Attorney General and the Secretaries of State, Treasury, Commerce, Defense, and Transportation, and the leadership of the DEA, the Border Patrol, Customs, and the INS have been integral to this effort.  Our common  response is to create a Southwest Border Counter-Drug White Paper for approval by the President during the fall of 1998.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those involving deliberative processes or attorney-client privilege. The creation of a policy document involving high-level officials and multiple agencies would likely involve such privileged communications.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • Last week, we (DPC, NSC and WH Counsel) met to discuss General McCaffrey's         ◦ proposed plans to coordinate federal agencies along Southwest Border. We are all in strong agreement that General McCaffrey has raised some very legitimate issues, and that he is in a good position to push the bureaucracy and make some improvements in how the federal government coordinates immigration, drug enforcement, interdiction and trade at the border. Still, we have some substantive and procedural concerns that he should know.	Yes, this could potentially be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications and deliberative process privilege. The mention of a meeting between the DPC, NSC, and WH Counsel to discuss substantive and procedural concerns related to General McCaffrey's proposed plans suggests that this may be a privileged communication related to the government's decision-making process. However, the ultimate determination of whether this information is exempt from FOIA disclosure would depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Substantive Issues:     • From DPC's perspective, we are in general agreement with McCaffrey on many aspects of his Southwest border proposal: the need for better border coordination at the ground level: heightened resources for enforcement such as Customs and Border Patrol; improvements to intelligence architecture; and updated drug-detection technology.

It jsn't necessary for all of us to attend every meeting he calls, but somebod from the WH must be involved and it must be made clear that he needs to include other components of the WH. To date he has not been open to coordinating with us (e.g., crack sentencing).	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to predecisional or deliberative communications within an agency. It is discussing procedural issues and coordination between different offices within the White House.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     I. Summary Inadequate dredging of the channels and berthing  areas serving  the Port of  New  York  and New Jersey, and the lack of leadership to solve the problem, have caused several major port companies to announce that they may  relocate their hub operations to Halifax,  Nova Scotia, or to other U.S. ports. Company decisions are expected in June or July. Fearful of job losses to Canada, the longshoremen have focused pressure to resolve dredging  issues on  Governors Pataki and Whitman. Concurrently, concern about disposal of contaminated dredged  material off New Jersey's coast has prompted Governor Whitman to criticize the  Administration's disposal policies as environmentally unsound. Her message has been lauded and reinforced by environmental groups and New Jersey shore communities, but it has further impeded needed dredging.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The information appears to involve discussions and decisions related to government policies and actions, which could potentially fall under the deliberative process privilege. However, the specific circumstances and context of the information would need to be evaluated to determine if exemption 5 applies.
D1			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The primary obstacle to full-scale dredging is the lack of acceptable disposal alternatives. Disposal alternatives are primarily a state responsibility, but  require federal  action. On  May 24, in an agreement with labor leaders, Governor Whitman promised that limited dredging of berthing areas would begin in June. We understand  that Governor  Whitman  is planning  a press conference on June 6 to announce the start of dredging, but port companies and unions remain highly skeptical. A visible, credible signal is therefore still needed to persuade the unions, port companies, and state governments that the  Administration  is  ready  to  get dredging moving as soon  as the states do their  part. We also  must  disarm  possible criticism on the environmental issues. Thus, the initiative  proposed  here is in  large  measure preemptive: we are increasing pressure on Whitman and Pataki to make tough decisions about local disposal options while protecting the President from  blame  either  for  imminent  job losses or for potential harm to the oceans. At  the same  time,  we  must  take care  not  to suggest too much Federal ""ownership"" of a problem that  inherently  must stay  on  the governors' doorsteps. The governors, not the Administration, must resolve politically divisive decisions about local disposal sites, and must negotiate between  themselves  the  relative benefits New York and New Jersey receive from Port Authority monies earmarked for dredging."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language about preemptively increasing pressure on state governors and protecting the President from blame could be seen as part of a deliberative process within the administration, which could be considered privileged. However, it would ultimately be up to a court to determine whether this information qualifies for exemption 5 protection.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Congressmen -Menendez and Torricelli, along with Senator Lautenberg, would  like to announce this initiative with us and to introduce a complementary bill to implement elements  of the initiative.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications. It is a statement made by public officials regarding a legislative initiative.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; This initiative is likely to receive support from port companies, the unions, and most of the Democrats in the New Jersey and New York delegations. A vocal segment  of  the environmental community, possibly joined by Representative Pallone, is likely to be critical or unsupportive at best, although we are hoping that the environmental elements of the initiative will win over Pallone and a few of  the  more  mainstream  environmental  groups. Criticism also is possible from Representative Nadler, who has been pushing an ambitious (and probably impracticable) plan to require more dredging (and thus generate more development) for long-idle wharves in Brooklyn.	It is unlikely that this statement would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not appear to contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of a government agency. It is simply a prediction of potential support and criticism from various groups and individuals.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Delegations from states that compete with New York may raise questions of favoritism. In particular Norfolk, Virginia stands to gain from New York's losses, and Baltimore has ----- -------- competitive disadvantages of its own. To a lesser degree, Connecticut is concerned that any action we take in New York has the potential to raise the visibility of similar challenges in Connecticut ports. Several elements in the initiative (such  as cost-sharing  upland  disposal) will benefit these other ports as well as New York and New Jersey, however, so we currently expect affirmative support for the initiative from these other ports as well as national port organizations.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances of the communication. If the communication was part of an internal deliberative process and contained pre-decisional or deliberative information, it may be exempt from disclosure. However, if the communication was simply a factual statement or did not involve any deliberative process, it may not be exempt. Ultimately, the determination of whether this information is exempt from disclosure would be made by the agency in response to a FOIA request.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     II. Timing House members feel strongly that an announcement needs to occur  before  the June 11 markup of the water resources development authorization bill. Before any announcement we need to consult with Members of Congress, labor leaders, moderate environmental interests. We may then adjust the elements of the initiative, to ensure strong support from those groups.	It is possible that this could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication. If it is a confidential internal discussion among government officials about strategy and decision-making, it may be considered privileged. However, if it is simply a routine communication about scheduling and consultation with outside groups, it may not be considered privileged. Ultimately, the determination of whether this communication is exempt from FOIA would be up to the agency or court reviewing the request.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     III. Recommendation	As an AI language model, I do not have access to the specific context of the recommendation mentioned in the question. However, in general, FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are privileged and confidential, such as those containing legal advice or deliberative process information. If the recommendation falls under this category, it may be protected under exemption 5. It is important to note that the determination of whether a document is exempt under FOIA exemption 5 is made on a case-by-case basis and depends on the specific content and context of the document.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We recommend that you approve a five-point plan for the Port that  would  be announced before House markup of the water resources development  authorization  bill. The five points of the plan would be as follows, and are detailed in the attachment:	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents. It is a recommendation for a plan to be announced publicly.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 1. Federal resources will be ready when /he Sia/es choose their disposal sites. 2. We will keep the federal rules clear, and make decisions quickly and protectively 3 We will restore and protect significant coastal habitats and resources.     4. We will seek alternatives to ocean and estuary dumping.     5. We will help prepare the port for the 21st century	No, these statements do not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which pertains to privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and certain law enforcement records. These statements appear to be general policy statements and goals, rather than privileged communications.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In developing this recommendation we have consulted closely with the Departments of Transportation and the Army and with the Environmental Protection Agency. The Secretaries concur with this recommendation, with the exception  that EPA  reserves its judgment  on  two of the detailed elements pending the outcome of our consultations with environmental interests, and one element is undergoing separate legal and policy review. All agree that whether  this  announcement  should  be  made  by  the  President  or  by  the  Secretaries   will  depend on the outcome of the consultation process.	Yes, this could potentially be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The consultation process with other agencies and environmental interests may be considered privileged communication. However, the specific determination would depend on the specific circumstances and the agency's justification for withholding the information.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     IV. Decision         Approve         Disapprove       Let's Discuss •	As an AI language model, I do not have the necessary context to determine whether the given information would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. However, exemption 5 generally covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and deliberative process privilege. It would depend on the specific content and context of the information in question.
T0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; June 17, 1996 MEMORANDUM FOR HAROLD ICKES THROUGH: Jennifer M. O'Connor FROM:   Bradley M. Campbell Diane Regas SUBJECT:    New York-New Jersey Harbor Dredging - Status	It is possible that this memorandum could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications such as attorney-client communications and deliberative process privilege. However, without more information about the content of the memorandum and the context in which it was created, it is impossible to definitively determine whether it would be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We have discussed the draft ""Healthy Port Initiative"" with labor unions; port operators and shipping interests; moderate environmentalists; Representatives Menendez, Pallone, and Torricelli; and Senator Lautenberg's  staff.  Below  is a summary  of the  remaining  issues and our recommended next steps. We have consulted with EPA and OMB in making our recommendation, and they agree."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The fact that the agency consulted with EPA and OMB in making their recommendation suggests that the information may be considered privileged. However, the specific content of the draft and the nature of the discussions with the various stakeholders would need to be further analyzed to determine if exemption 5 applies.
T0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Summary	As an AI language model, I am unable to determine the context of the summary. FOIA exemption 5 generally protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. However, the specific application of exemption 5 would depend on the content of the summary and the agency's justification for withholding it.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; While there is consensus on most elements of the initiative, there remains  a  sharp  divide between Rep. Menendez Goined by the ports and the unions), and Congressmen Pallone and Torricelli Goined by environmental  groups  and  possibly  Governor  Whitman)  over  two central issues:	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and attorney work product. The language used in the passage suggests that it may be discussing internal deliberations or negotiations between different parties, which could fall under the deliberative process privilege. However, without more context it is difficult to say for certain whether this information would be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • The Mud Dump Site (MDS): A dredge  material  disposal  site offshore  but  near Pallone's district. Federal law and policy now allows  disposal  of  category  I  and category 2 dredge material  at  this site.  (Category  I  is clean;  category  2 passes  tests but has some contamination; category 3 is not suitable for disposal in the ocean.) Governor Whitman has pledged not  to  put category  2 in  the  ocean,  and  that  pledge has been strongly endorsed by environmental groups and  shore  newspapers,  but there  are very few alternatives for category 2 disposal in the short  term.  Our  initiative proposed a decision by January 31, 1997 concerning the phase out of the Mud Dump Site, with the consideration of the alternatives for disposal.	"It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and certain law enforcement records. The mention of ""federal law and policy"" and ""Governor Whitman's pledge"" suggest that there may be internal deliberations or legal advice related to the disposal of dredge material at the Mud Dump Site that could be protected under this exemption. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances and context of the information."
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • The EPA testing rule. This is a proposed rule revising  the regulations  governing how and when to test for contamination  in dredge material.    A New Jersey federal court opinion argues that EPA's technical manuals conflict with its underlying regulation -- rendering permits legally vulnerable. Environmentalists have derided EPA's rule as a ""rollback""  of ocean protection. Unions and port operators want the rule finalized as soon as possible, believing the rule change essential if permits to dispose material at the MDS are to survive court challenges. Our initiative proposed EPA action on the rule by August 1, I 996."	It is possible that some portions of this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications and deliberative process. However, without more specific information about the content and context of the information, it is difficult to determine definitively whether it would be exempt.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Positions	No, positions would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications, such as those between an attorney and client or those that would be protected by the deliberative process privilege.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • Menendez: Wants continued use of the MD.S  for both category  I  and  2 material,  and continued ocean disposal of category 2 generally.  Wants  EPA  to finalize  its rule in August, to provide certainty to permit applicants.	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer as to whether the mentioned text would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. However, exemption 5 generally covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and deliberative process privilege. Whether the mentioned text falls under any of these categories would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the communication.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • Pallone-Torricelli:   Want closure of MDS after an additional 300,000 cubic yards of category 2, or alternatively after category 2 capacity needs  have  been  met  through 1997.   Want  EPA  to postpone  its rule indefinitely.    In offering these proposals, Torricelli and Pallone are negotiating, in part, on behalf of the environmental groups whose support they  need  in  the  corning  elections.  (Representative  Zimmer, Torriceili's opponent in  the current  Senate  race,  reportedly  has  prepared advertisements castigating Torricelli for supporting ocean dumping.)	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The fact that Torricelli and Pallone are negotiating on behalf of environmental groups and discussing political strategy suggests that this information may be considered privileged. However, it would ultimately be up to a court to determine whether this exemption applies in this case.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Recommendation	It depends on the context and content of the recommendation. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are privileged or contain deliberative process information. If the recommendation is a part of such a document, it may be protected under exemption 5. However, if the recommendation is a standalone document or does not contain privileged or deliberative information, it may not be protected under exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We recommend that the Administration make a counter-proposal to Pallone and  Torricelli, with the following elements:	As an AI language model, I do not have personal beliefs or opinions. However, the statement provided does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and attorney work product. The statement appears to be a recommendation or proposal, which does not fall under any of the categories of privileged communications.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • We would immediately begin  administrative  action  to close  the MDS  to category  2 at the end I997. This action would require a public proposal (this summer), a comment period, and a final  decision  (early  I997).  We  would  make  the  proposal and indicate our intention to close the  site,  but  would  not  pre-judge  the  final outcome of this process.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. Specifically, the statement could be considered pre-decisional and deliberative, as it outlines a proposed course of action and the process for making a final decision, but does not definitively state what that decision will be. However, whether or not this statement would actually be protected would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding it, as well as any other relevant factors that may come into play.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • We would insist that the MDS be available as necessary until the end of 1997 for disposal of category 1 and 2 material. This  may  require  an  increase  in elevation  at the site.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the statement was part of a privileged communication between government officials discussing the disposal of hazardous materials, it may be withheld from public release under this exemption. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances and context of the statement.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • We would agree to delay the EPA rule until  all of the issues  have  been  discussed with environmentalists and other stakeholders, including a process to  examine scientific issues related to the rule. We anticipate  that  this  process  will  take  six to ten months.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. If the statement was made as part of internal deliberations or discussions between government officials, it could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5. However, if the statement was made publicly or to external stakeholders, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this statement is exempt from disclosure under FOIA would depend on the specific circumstances surrounding its creation and dissemination.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • We would require, as a condition of these  commitments,  that  key  environmental groups agree to not challenge permits to dispose of category I and 2 material  at  the MDS (using the existing testing rule) until the end of I997.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific circumstances and the nature of the communication. If the communication was between government officials discussing legal strategy or advice, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, if the communication was simply a request or agreement between the government and environmental groups, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this information is exempt from disclosure would be made by the agency in response to a FOIA request.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Pros: This proposal is very close to that outlined by Pallone and Torricelli,  except  that we would use an appropriate administrative process  to  decide  on  closure  of  the  MDS  rather than announcing closure by fiat, and we  would  reject  the strict  volume  limitation  they propose in the interim. We would expect  that this will  disarm  environmental  criticism  and help move short-term dredging, but we would  want  to  elicit  an  understanding  with  New York and New Jersey that they will not be criticize short-term use of the MDS.	It is possible that this could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances of the communication.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Cons: It will be difficult to convince  Representative  Menendez  that  this  approach  makes sense. Our position will be that  this  approach  will  accomplish  what  he  needs  by  ensuring that dredging can go on for the next year, while allowing  continued  use of the  MDS  for the very short term: In addition it will allow the EPA rule issues to  be  resolved  in  a  less contentious climate, after  further  work  with  affected  interests,  thereby  reducing  the likelihood  of  litigation  over  the rule itself.    We will need to work  closely  with  Menendez and his staff to help them understand the merits of delaying the rule, and enlist their help in persuading the unions and port companies that this  is the right course.  We  propose  to have those discussions in	particular, the portion discussing the approach to convince Representative Menendez and the need to work closely with him and his staff would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not fall under the deliberative process privilege. However, the portion discussing the EPA rule issues and the potential for litigation over the rule itself may be protected under exemption 5 as it pertains to pre-decisional and deliberative information.
