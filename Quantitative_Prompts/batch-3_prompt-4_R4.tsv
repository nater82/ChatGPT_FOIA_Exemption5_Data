Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are ""predecisional"" and ""deliberative"" in nature. This means that the document must be created before a final decision is made and must contain opinions, recommendations, or thought processes related to the decision-making process.; ; Without knowing the content of the memorandum, it is impossible to determine whether it meets these criteria. However, if the memorandum contains opinions or recommendations related to a decision that has not yet been made, it may be protected under exemption 5.; ; Case law that supports this conclusion includes NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975), which established that exemption 5 protects documents that are ""predecisional"" and ""deliberative"" in nature. Additionally, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v.

The package of child support collection initiatives includes intercepting gambling winnings from parents who owe support, which will collect about $350 million for families and raise nearly $190 million in federal revenues over five years.

The match inquiry would report back: I) there is no match and the individual does not owe past due child support; 2) the individual owes past due child support which exceeds the amount of the individual's winnings, therefore, the entire amount of winnings should be retained; or 3) the individual owes child support but the amount does not exceed the amount of winnings; therefore, only the amount of child support owed should be retained. 2	"It is possible that this memorandum could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The memorandum appears to be an internal communication between staff members of the Chief of Staff's office, and it discusses a potential policy proposal related to child support and gambling. This could be considered a deliberative communication, as it involves the consideration of different options and the weighing of potential consequences.; ; However, whether or not this memorandum would actually be protected under exemption 5 would depend on a number of factors, including the specific context in which it was created and the nature of the information it contains. For example, if the memorandum contains purely factual information that is not part of any deliberative process, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Additionally, if the policy proposal discussed in the memorandum has already been implemented or publicly announced, the memorandum may no longer be considered privileged.; ; Without more information about the context and content of the memorandum, it is difficult to say definitively whether it would be protected under exemption 5. However, a relevant case to consider in this context is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), which established the ""deliberative process privilege"" as a component of exemption 5. This privilege protects communications that are part of an agency's decision-making process and that would be ""chilled"" if subject to disclosure, as it would discourage frank and open discussion among agency officials."

This type of deliberative process is often considered privileged because it is intended to facilitate decision-making within the agency and may involve candid or sensitive discussions that would be inhibited if they were subject to public disclosure.; ; However, whether or not this information is actually protected under exemption 5 would depend on a number of factors, including the specific context and purpose of the communication, the identities of the individuals involved, and the nature of any legal or policy considerations at issue. Without more information, it is difficult to say definitively whether this message would be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.; ; One case that may be relevant to this analysis is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court established a two-part test for determining whether a document is protected under exemption 5. The test requires courts to consider (1) whether the document is predecisional, meaning that it was prepared in anticipation of a decision or policy action, and (2) whether the document is deliberative, meaning that it reflects the give-and-take of the decision-making process rather than simply stating a final decision or policy. If both of these criteria are met, the document may be protected under exemption 5. However, the Court also noted that the exemption is not absolute and may be overcome if the public interest in disclosure outweighs the government's interest in keeping the information confidential.

However, without more information about the content of the message, it is difficult to determine whether it contains privileged information that would qualify for exemption 5 protection.; ; Case law has established that the deliberative process privilege, which is a subset of exemption 5, protects communications that are part of the decision-making process within an agency.

If it does contain deliberative information, the agency may argue that it is protected under exemption 5. However, if the requester can demonstrate a strong public interest in the information, such as if it relates to a matter of significant public concern, the agency's interest in confidentiality may be outweighed and the information may be subject to disclosure.

Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; 22 USC 6503.; ; Background: The purpose of 22 USC 6503 was to enforce the provisions of certain conventions entered into with foreign governments that permit commercial travelers (foreign traveling salesmen) of Contracting Parties to operate in the United States. Enacted in 1922, this Act authorized the Department of Commerce to 1) issue licenses to manufacturers, merchants and traders domiciled in the other Contracting Party to operate as commercial travelers in the United States, and 2) issue certificates  attesting  that  a manufacturer, merchant or trader domiciled in the United States was a commercial traveler.	It is unlikely that 22 USC 6503 would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This statute appears to be a public law that sets forth the authority and procedures for the Department of Commerce to issue licenses and certificates related to commercial travel. It does not involve any internal deliberations or communications within the agency that would qualify as privileged. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law that addresses the applicability of exemption 5 to 22 USC 6503, as this statute does not involve the type of privileged information that is typically covered by this exemption. However, courts have generally interpreted exemption 5 narrowly and have required agencies to demonstrate that the withheld information falls within one of the recognized privileges, such as attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. Since 22 USC 6503 does not involve such privileges, it is unlikely to be protected under exemption 5.

Background: Under current law, states generally retain child support collected on behalf of TANF-assisted families as one of several sources of program financing. This .support is split between the State and Federal Government  as  reimbursement  for  welfare  services.  Under welfare reform, states were given the option of continuing  the  previous  $50 pass-through,  but most states have opted not to do so. However, some pass-through a portion (typically $50) and disregard this amount in calculating the family's  TANF  benefits.  A  few  (including  Wisconsin and Vermont) have federal waivers which allow them  to pass-through  all of the support collected to the family. Wisconsin disregards the support in calculating assistance -- Vermont does not.	"It is possible that the information provided in this background would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This could include internal discussions or deliberations related to the Pass-Through Option Bill, as well as any legal advice or opinions provided by agency attorneys. However, without more specific information about the nature of the requested records, it is difficult to make a definitive determination.; ; One case that may be relevant is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 covers ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" The Court also noted that the exemption is intended to protect the ""decision-making processes of government agencies"" by allowing for frank and candid discussions among officials.; ; Overall, whether or not the information in question would be protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific content and context of the requested records."

Kohl's Pass-Through Option Bill; ;     II. Issues: 1) Disincentives: Non-custodial parents of TANF assisted children are discouraged from paying support because their money goes to the government and does not benefit their children directly. Custodial parents also have less incentive to cooperate with the CSE agency since payments are generally not forwarded to them. 2) Burdens: Support is distributed according to when it accrues, whether a family is or ever was on public assistance and by which method it is collected. This distribution system has proven burdensome and costly both in terms of programming and personnel. 3)Unstable Financing: CSE c.aseloads have increased 44 percent since 1991, but TANF caseloads are decreasing. As discussed, states retain TANF collections, but distribute non-TANF collections directly to the families. Thus, increasing caseloads are generating a need for more resources, but the revenue-making portion of the caseloads is in flux.	"It is unclear whether the above information would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not appear to fall under any of the specific categories of information that are typically protected under this exemption (e.g. inter-agency or intra-agency communications, attorney-client privileged information, etc.). However, without more context about the specific document or records in question, it is difficult to make a definitive determination.; ; Case law that may be relevant to this issue includes NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975), which established the ""deliberative process privilege"" as a component of exemption 5. This privilege protects documents that are ""predecisional"" and ""deliberative"" in nature, meaning they were created before a final decision was made and contain opinions, recommendations, or advice related to that decision-making process. However, this privilege is not absolute and may be overcome if the requester can demonstrate a strong public interest in disclosure.; ; In the case of Sen. Kohl's Pass-Through Option Bill, it is possible that some of the information related to the issues identified (e.g. data on caseloads, distribution systems, etc.) could be considered predecisional or deliberative if it was part of an internal agency discussion about potential policy changes or legislative proposals. However, if the information is already publicly available or has been finalized as part of a decision-making process, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether the information is exempt would depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case."

This privilege allows agencies to withhold documents that are predecisional and deliberative in nature, meaning they were created before a final decision was made and contain opinions, recommendations, or advice about that decision.; ; However, it is important to note that the deliberative process privilege is not absolute and can be overcome if the requester can show a strong public interest in disclosure that outweighs the government's interest in keeping the information confidential. Additionally, the privilege only applies to documents that are both predecisional and deliberative, so any final versions of the bill or other official records related to its passage would not be protected.; ; There is some case law that supports the potential application of exemption 5 to internal communications about legislative drafting. For example, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v.

Under AFDC, the first fifty dollars of child support collected on behalf of a family was ""passed-through"" to the family currently on welfare. The remaining child support collections were split between the state and federal government (according to state medicaid match rates). Since the $50 ""pass-th.rough"" was not counted as income, it increased the amount of the welfare grant by  $50.  The idea behind this was to give mothers a financial incentive to cooperate with child support enforcement. Under TANF, the fifty dollar ""pass-through"" was repealed and states must first pay the federal government its share of the child support collections (again, according to the state medicaid match rates). The rest of the child support collected on behalf of a family currently on welfare is distributed at the discretion of the state. If the state wants to continue distributing $ 50  of the child support collected on behalf of a family to that family, it may do so (although the  $50  will come from the state's share of the child support  collection,  not  off  the top as under AFDC rules). In this case, the welfare check again increases by $50. Unfortunately, most states (29 according to the ""One Year After"" paper) have decided not to pass-through any amount of the child support coHected on behalf of a family with the resu.lt that  child support  collections  have no affect on the size of the ' welfare grant in these states (unless, of course, the amount of child support collected is greater than the welfare  grant  at  which point the welfare grant is reduced to O and the family gets the full child support payment). In the 22 states with a child support  pass through, the size of the welfare grant is affected by child support collections, equal to the amount of the pass-through  (in most of these states, it is still $50.)"

As such, it could be argued that the communication is part of the deliberative process and therefore falls under the deliberative process privilege. ; ; The deliberative process privilege protects communications that are part of the decision-making process, including opinions, recommendations, and advice. The purpose of the privilege is to encourage open and frank discussions within agencies without fear of public disclosure. ; ; However, whether or not this memorandum would be protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding its creation and dissemination. For example, if the memorandum was later disseminated to individuals outside of the White House or used to make a final decision, it may not be protected under the deliberative process privilege. ; ; There is no specific case law cited in this scenario, so it is difficult to determine with certainty whether or not the memorandum would be protected under exemption 5.

It is possible that the record described could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

The fact that the email is addressed to specific individuals within the EOP suggests that it may be an internal communication that is part of the agency's decision-making process.; ; However, whether or not the record is actually protected under exemption 5 would depend on whether it meets the criteria for one of the recognized privileges, such as the deliberative process privilege or the attorney-client privilege. The fact that the email discusses potential announcements at a political event may weigh against a claim of privilege, as it suggests that the communication may be more about political strategy than policy deliberation.; ; Without more information about the content of the email and the context in which it was sent, it is difficult to say definitively whether it would be protected under exemption 5. However, a case that may be relevant is Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2004), in which the D.C. Circuit held that emails between White House officials discussing potential announcements at a political event were not protected by the deliberative process privilege because they were primarily about political strategy rather than policy deliberation.

It is possible that the record could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The record appears to be a communication between members of the Office of the President (OPD) at the Executive Office of the President (EOP) regarding potential announcements at the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC). This could potentially involve discussions of policy or strategy that are considered privileged and confidential. However, without more information about the content of the record, it is difficult to make a definitive determination.; ; One case that may support the application of exemption 5 in this context is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975). In that case, the Supreme Court held that the deliberative process privilege, which is a component of exemption 5, protects communications that are part of the decision-making process of an agency. This includes communications that are predecisional and deliberative in nature, as well as those that are part of the agency's internal decision-making process. The Court also noted that the privilege is intended to protect the quality of agency decision-making by encouraging open and candid discussions among agency officials.; ; Based on this case law and the limited information provided about the record in question, it is possible that the record could be protected under exemption 5. However, a more detailed analysis would be necessary to make a definitive determination.

The Senate bill propsed to fund this program out of SSA 1 for $23 million a year max over five years, starting in year 2. During our budget process, we ,developed a proposal that combined the Planners with one of the Task Force recommendations for Systems Change in DOL, for a tota of $50million a year, beginning year one (roughly $23.million going to the Planners, the rest for Systems Change).

They are separately exploring ways to appropriate funds for the Task Force Systems Change component. But, as we have discussed in recent meetings, the language would require SSA to fund the Planners out of its discretionary Administrative account, and SSA cannot therefore guarantee it will have the resources  to  operate the program.

The record appears to be a communication between government officials regarding a meeting with representatives from a disability advocacy group. The fact that the meeting is being scheduled and the attendees are listed suggests that the communication is part of the agency's decision-making process and therefore falls under the deliberative process privilege. This privilege protects communications that are part of the agency's decision-making process and that would be withheld from disclosure in civil litigation. ; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that the deliberative process privilege protects communications that are part of the agency's decision-making process and that would be withheld from disclosure in civil litigation. Another relevant case is Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854 (D.C. Cir. 1980), in which the D.C. Circuit held that the deliberative process privilege applies to communications that are part of the agency's decision-making process, even if they do not contain opinions or recommendations.

For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., the Supreme Court held that internal agency memoranda discussing legal strategy were protected under exemption 5 because they were part of the agency's decision-making process and contained pre-decisional deliberations. Similarly, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. DOE, the D.C.

Specifically, they asked about the 10 year window, whether  disability  reviews  would be  conducted after an individual stops receiving DI cash benefits (they read it as ""no""), and. costs."	The provided text does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The text appears to be a summary of a meeting between government officials and staff from the Ways and Means committee, discussing questions related to Medicare. There is no indication that the text contains privileged legal advice or deliberative information that would be exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.; ; Case law supports this interpretation. In Tax Analysts v. IRS, the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 only applies to materials that are both predecisional and deliberative in nature, meaning they were created before a final decision was made and contain opinions or recommendations regarding that decision. The text provided does not appear to meet this standard, as it is a summary of a meeting rather than a deliberative document. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
