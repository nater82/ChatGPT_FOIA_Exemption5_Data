D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; HHS may want to raise the bucket as part of the technicals discussion Ron wants to have. Here's the story: for many months, HHS could only see their way clear to a partial fix of the bucket. Just as we were about to give up on this, Clay Shaw wrote a letter saying congressional intent was a 100% fix of the bucket. This caused HHS to go back to the drawing board (for months). They now see a way to do a 100% fix, but their legal theory conflicts with OMB counsel's theory, and for the moment it's stuck there.	Yes, this could potentially be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of legal theory and conflicting counsel suggests that this discussion may involve attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege, both of which fall under exemption 5. However, without more context it is difficult to determine definitively whether this information would be exempt.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; So HHS wants to throw into the technical mix the possibility that Congress could clarify this issue, and they may raise it at our conference call tomorrow. OMB doesn’t disagree. | don't see any downside, other than if we have to use a chit for it. But Haskins is on our side here, so it may not use a chit.	"Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be a discussion between two agencies (HHS and OMB) about a potential issue that may be raised by Congress. The mention of using a ""chit"" suggests that this is an internal discussion about strategy or tactics, which would likely be considered privileged. Additionally, the mention of Haskins being ""on our side"" suggests that this is a discussion about internal agency politics or alliances, which would also likely be considered privileged."
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; This morning | said we'd no longer need the bucket if the budget agreement becomes law. Not exactly so. Even with the budget agreement, some legal immigrants -- the elderly non-disabled -- who were in the U.S. before the welfare law was enacted will not get Medicaid coverage. States who wish to cover them without vastly expanding their Medicaid programs could do so if the bucket were enacted.	The passage would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The passage does not appear to be a communication between government agencies or officials, nor does it appear to be part of a decision-making process. It is a statement made by an individual about the potential impact of a budget agreement on Medicaid coverage for certain legal immigrants.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Ken is saying we can't do the bucket by 4/1, because CBO is reestimating the baseline in early/mid April and we don’t want it out before then. We are pressing him on his logic, since the cost of the bucket is already in the budget as a legislative proposal.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of CBO reestimating the baseline and the desire to avoid releasing the bucket proposal before that time could be seen as part of the agency's internal decision-making process and therefore privileged. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the statement.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Can we do by April 1?	"No, the statement ""Can we do by April 1?"" would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement in question does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5."
D0//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; This e-mail 1) notifies you that the Health Division communicated your guidance to HCFA on the three Medicaid “welfare reform"" issues and 2) outlines HCFA's response to your guidance."	"It is possible that this e-mail could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The e-mail appears to involve communication between the Health Division and HCFA regarding Medicaid ""welfare reform"" issues, which could potentially involve sensitive policy discussions or legal advice. However, without more information about the specific content of the e-mail and the context in which it was sent, it is difficult to make a definitive determination about whether exemption 5 would apply."
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 1) SSI One-Month Gap -- We communicated to HCFA that the one-month gap policy should be made administratively through an All States Letter to the Medicaid Directors as well. HCFA will send over the All States Letter for OMB clearance later this week.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The communication between the agency and HCFA regarding the one-month gap policy is likely considered privileged because it involves the agency's internal decision-making process and the development of policy. Additionally, the fact that HCFA is seeking OMB clearance suggests that the communication is part of a deliberative process that is protected under exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 2) Medically-Needy -- We communicated to HCFA that the medically needy policy should be made administratively through an All States Letter to the Medicaid Directors as opposed to promulgating a regulation. HCFA said that they would discuss this option with their Office of General Counsel and notify us if they had any legal concerns. If not, HCFA will send over the All States Letter for OMB clearance. HCFA mentioned that they would like to distribute one All States Letter that would include both the medically needy policy and the delay regulation.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The communication between the agency and HCFA regarding the legally preferred method of implementing a policy and the potential legal concerns involved would likely be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 3) Delay Regulation -- We communicated to HCFA that you approved of announcing HCFA's intention to promulgate this regulation, since the NPRM process could delay the impact of qualified aliens losing SSI. HCFA wants to send out on All States Letter to the Medicaid Directors announcing this policy and to advise that States could retain Medicaid coverage for SSI recipients in the meantime.	It is possible that this communication could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The communication appears to involve discussions between two agencies (HCFA and another agency) regarding the announcement of a regulation and the potential impact on SSI recipients. The content of the communication may involve legal advice or deliberative process, which could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5. However, without more information about the specific content and context of the communication, it is difficult to make a definitive determination.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; First, we will schedule a meeting early next week with HCFA, OIRA, and the Health Division to discuss this regulation. Second, HCFA will send over the All States Letter for OMB clearance. This letter will include both the medically needy policy and the announcement of HCFA's intention to promulgate the delay regulation.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The discussion of the regulation and the sending of the All States Letter for OMB clearance are both likely to be considered privileged communications related to the agency's decision-making process.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; We also noted to HCFA that these policies should be handled administratively with little publicity. HCFA agreed. To ensure a consolidated process, OMB policy officials need to coordinate with other EXOP officials in order to convey that these policies should be handled with minimal publicity.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement suggests that there was internal discussion and coordination between HCFA and OMB officials regarding the handling of certain policies, and that they agreed to handle them with minimal publicity. This suggests that the statement is part of an internal deliberative process, which is protected under exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Latest status: We, especially OMB, are considering whether to do HHS's administrative fix to the bucket. It is not the advocates’ full fix, but a 2-part regulatory fix HHS devised: a temporary delay for everyone, which will help all states with a bucket problem; and a new policy on how states define “medically needy” Medicaid programs, which will permanently help some states with a bucket problem. Between the 2 parts, it will fix a decent portion of the bucket, but not all. (I will try to get a sense of how much.)	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing internal deliberations and considerations regarding potential regulatory fixes, which would likely fall under the umbrella of privileged communications. Additionally, the statement does not appear to contain any information that would be considered a public record subject to disclosure under FOIA.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Nancy-Ann's first take is that Raines needs to decide whether HCFA must come up with an offset to the $1.9 billion cost. Ken and | have pointed out that we fixed a lot of the bucket in our welfare legistative fix package, in our proposal to exempt the disabled from SSI/Medicaid cuts. So theoretically we have already paid for a lot of this, and we're just transferring it from a legislative fix to an administrative fix. OMB is trying to scope out the overlap and numbers as they write a memo to Raines.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The discussion appears to involve internal deliberations and analysis regarding the potential costs and funding sources for a proposed administrative fix, which would likely be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under this exemption.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; lam assuming we would agree with HHS's approach. | think we exhausted the advocates’ approach. And it will do good things for people and it's fully or largely paid for. | should note that it could take a bit of the steam out of our legal immigrant fix package, since the most compelling cases of legal immigrants in nursing homes would then be temporarily addressed. 1 think the only exception to that would be in states that affirmatively decide not to extend Medicaid to legals, and i'm not sure there are any such states at this time.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. This statement does not appear to be deliberative in nature and does not provide any insight into the decision-making process. It is simply a statement of opinion and speculation about the potential impact of a policy decision.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Option of total administrative fix off the table, unless COLO)sees something new.	It is possible that the statement would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be an internal communication within an agency, and it suggests that there may be legal or policy considerations that prevent the agency from pursuing a certain course of action. However, without more context it is difficult to determine whether the statement would qualify for exemption 5 protection.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; - Budget's welfare legislative fix package includes partial fix for the bucket: exempt disabled legal immigrants from SSI cuts. This leaves out the elderly.	Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The information appears to be part of an internal discussion or decision-making process related to the budget and legislative proposals, and therefore could be considered privileged. Additionally, the information may be considered pre-decisional, meaning it was created before a final decision was made, which would also make it exempt under exemption 5.
D1//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; - HHS's best admin fix thinking had 2 parts: -across the board 1 year delay; and -""medically needy” reg that will help some states."	"It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of ""HHS's best admin fix thinking"" suggests that this is an internal discussion or decision-making process within the agency, which could be considered privileged. However, the specific details of the proposed delay and regulation may not necessarily be privileged, and could potentially be released under FOIA. Ultimately, the determination of whether this information is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances and context surrounding its creation and dissemination."
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Neither of these last 2 are in the budget so, if we want to go ahead with them, we can't talk about them Till the budget's beén out for a while. But we could theoretically tell the groups whe the budge is released that we continue to ponder the question of admin fixes.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The statement appears to be discussing internal deliberations about potential administrative fixes that are not yet included in the budget. As such, it could be considered part of the agency's decision-making process and therefore exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The OMB director has apparently at last opined on the “bucket” issue -- i.e., whether there is an administrative way to allow more people losing SSI to keep Medicaid.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be an internal communication from the OMB director, and as such, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under FOIA. Additionally, the statement may contain deliberative process information, which is also protected under exemption 5.
D1//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Raines endorsed HHS's partial fix, which we've also been pushing. (HHS rejected on legal grounds the advocates’ argument that we could do a total fix, where no one would lose Medicaid as a result of losing SSI.) This partial fix would create a temporary ""bucket"" for everyone losing SSI (for a year, | think). And it would beef up what is included in a “medically needy” program in a way that would help a group of states."	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language used in the passage suggests that it is discussing internal deliberations and decision-making within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regarding a policy change related to Medicaid and SSI. The mention of legal grounds and advocacy arguments also suggests that this is a sensitive and potentially confidential matter. Therefore, it is likely that this information would be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The effect of this will be to convert part of our fix package from legislative to administrative. It also means health providers will be less interested in our package.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency that is part of a decision-making process. It is a statement about the potential effects of a decision, but it does not reveal any internal deliberations or recommendations.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; OMB doesn't think we should announce anything in the next week or two, because CBO is doing some baseline reestimate.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be a communication between two agencies, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and it pertains to the timing of an announcement. The fact that OMB is considering the advice of CBO regarding a baseline reestimate suggests that this is a deliberative process, which is also covered under exemption 5. Therefore, this statement would likely be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; While we have never been certain that this confusing issue could be packaged into some kind of | announcement or event, OMB would apparently oppose making a big deal about this publicly. They are nervous that we'll be criticized. Not sure this makes sense.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The statement appears to be a discussion between two government agencies (the speaker's agency and OMB) about a potentially controversial issue. The fact that OMB is nervous about public criticism suggests that they are discussing a sensitive matter that they would prefer to keep confidential. Therefore, this statement would likely be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; This shou ROT pe announced or alluded to in our legal immigration briefing tomorrow.	It is possible that the statement would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing a legal briefing, which could be considered an internal communication within an agency. Additionally, the statement suggests that the information should not be disclosed, which could indicate that it is privileged or confidential. However, without more context it is difficult to determine definitively whether exemption 5 would apply.
T0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; There will be a staff level discussion within a few days on whether we should have an Administration bill on Superfund. Superfund reauthorization remains a priority for the majority in the Congress, and we will need to decide the Administration strategy soon. CEQ is contemplating calling a principal's meeting early next week.	"Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of a staff level discussion and a potential Administration bill on Superfund suggests that this is an internal deliberation within the agency, and the reference to a ""principal's meeting"" further suggests that this is a high-level discussion that may involve sensitive or confidential information. As such, it is likely that this communication would be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under FOIA."
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; This note is to ask your engagement on the process and to quickly summarize the options for strategy and my recommendation.	It is possible that this note could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the note was written by a government official as part of their official duties and contains advice, recommendations, or opinions related to the decision-making process, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, the specific circumstances surrounding the note and the agency involved would need to be considered to determine if exemption 5 applies.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; With regard to the process, | believe that any principal's meeting on this should be jointly convened mol by CEQ and NEC. @ economic issues are some of the driving issues here. A jointly convened : Séting W sénd an important message of balance on this issue. | plan to make this argument at the staff level. | suggest that you mention this to Gene Sperling.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, the statement does not contain any deliberative information or opinions related to a decision-making process. It is simply a suggestion for how to convene a meeting and send a message of balance on an issue. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The strategy options are three:	"No, the statement ""The strategy options are three"" would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, the statement provided is a simple factual statement and does not involve any deliberation or decision-making process. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5."
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A) Prepare Administration principles, but allow agency assistance to both majority and minority staff to improve/prepare their bills. (There is a republican bill, there is as yet no dem alternative.) [It would need to be absolutely clear that assistance does not guarantee Administration endorsement. EPA is likely to support this view.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The fact that the EPA is likely to support the view that assistance does not guarantee Administration endorsement suggests that there may be internal deliberations or communications related to this issue that could be considered privileged. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific content of the documents and whether they meet the criteria for exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; B) Prepare a narrow Administration bill. This approach would send three key signals: (1) we are serious about reform, (2) all Departments will have a voice, and (3) we will only support moderate changes. CEQ is leaning slightly towards this view.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. The language suggests that this is an internal discussion among members of the administration about how to approach a legislative proposal, and therefore falls under the exemption for pre-decisional and deliberative materials. Additionally, the fact that CEQ is mentioned suggests that this is a confidential communication within a specific agency, further supporting the argument for exemption.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; C) Prepare a broad Administration bill. This approach would likely provide the most comfort to DOE and DOD because they will see this as a potentially disciplining process for the other Agencies. DOJ (Lois Schiffer) would vehemently oppose this approach.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing internal deliberations and potential disagreements between different agencies, which could be considered privileged information. Additionally, the mention of DOJ's opposition suggests that this is a sensitive topic that the agency may not want to disclose publicly.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; | recommend that we initially support option A. In my view, the key supporting reasons are: 1) An Administration process to come up with a bill will be extremely contentious and will distract from our effectiveness on the Hill. 2) If we genuinely want a bill we will need to negotiate with the majority and there is no particular advantage to having spent months coming up with our own bill fist. 3) Principles that set a high standard, will provide guidance to negotiations and will provide thetorical cover to strengthen our hand in the negotiations.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The recommendation appears to be a communication between members of an agency or government entity, and it contains advice and opinions related to decision-making processes. As such, it could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The key weaknesses in this approach are: 1) Some departments will be unhappy enough to undertake their own discreet Hill efforts. | discount this concern because no matter what we do, departments will let their views be known to the Hill. While this adds a measure of chaos, which will likely create some interagency friction, | don't believe it is particularly damaging to the Administration as a whole. 2) We need to get key minority Representatives on board first, some of whom definitely do not want a bill to pass. 3) Environmentalists are likely to end up more critical of a bill that passes. 4) The Administration could be accused of not exercising leadership on this issue. My response would be that our leadership is in Brownfields and in the Administrative reforms.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement does not appear to be a privileged communication, but rather a discussion of potential weaknesses and concerns related to a policy approach. It does not contain legal advice, deliberative process material, or other types of privileged information that would be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Please let me know if you have concerns about my recommended approach.	"The statement ""Please let me know if you have concerns about my recommended approach"" would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. This statement does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government agency. It is a routine communication that does not reveal any decision-making process or policy considerations. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5."

D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; As the President said in his State of the Union address, we can be proud that after decades of finger-pointing and failure, we are now replacing welfare checks with paychecks. Welfare caseloads have fallen another 2.4 million in the first 13 months of the new welfare reform law, a decline of 4.3 million, or 30 percent, since President Clinton took office. The President’s 1999 budget will build on this success, providing several targeted new tools to help even more people move from welfare to work, while restoring certain food stamp cuts which had nothing to do with welfare reform.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. This statement is a public statement made by the President and is not a communication between agencies or within an agency. Additionally, it is not deliberative in nature as it is a statement of fact and policy.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Welfare to Work Housing Vouchers. The President's FY99 budget will take further steps to promote work and welfare reform through a new $283 million plan to provide 50,000 new housing vouchers to welfare recipients who need housing assistance in order to get or keep ajob. Families could use these housing vouchers to move closer to a new job, to reduce a long commute, or to secure more stable housing to eliminate emergencies that keep them from getting to work every day on time. These vouchers, awarded to communities on a competitive basis, will give people on welfare a new tool to make the transition to a job and succeed in the work place. ‘	This information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents that are typically covered by this exemption.

D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Welfare to Work Transportation. One of the biggest barriers facing people who move from welfare to work -- in cities and in rural areas -- is finding transportation to get to jobs, training programs, and child care centers. Few welfare recipients own cars. Existing mass transit does not provide adequate links to many suburban jobs at all, or within a reasonable commute time. In addition, many entry level jobs require evening or weekend hours that are poorly served by existing transit routes. To help welfare recipients and other low income workers get to where the jobs are, President Clinton has proposed a $100 million a year welfare to work transportation plan as part of his ISTEA reauthorization bill. This competitive grant program would assist states and localities in developing flexible transportation alternatives, such as van services.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

Explain your reasoning.; ; Food Stamps for Legal Immigrants: The President believes that legal immigrants should have the same opportunity, and bear the same responsibility, as other members of society. To that end, the President’s 1999 budget proposes to restore Food Stamp benefits for vulnerable groups of legal immigrants. The President’s proposals would provide Food Stamp benefits to 730,000 legal immigrants in 1999 at,a cost of $2.5 billion over 5 years. Specifically, benefits would be restored for: all families with ‘children; immigrants with disabilities and elderly immigrants age 65 and older who entered the U.S. before welfare reform was enacted, on the same basis as the SSI and Medicaid restorations in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act; refugees and asylees, whose eligibility would be extended from 5 to 7 years; Hmong immigrants who came to the U.S. after the Vietnam war; and certain Native Americans living along the Canadian and Mexican borders.

Specifically, this information could fall under the deliberative process privilege, which protects pre-decisional communications that are part of the agency's decision-making process. ; ; In this case, the information pertains to a legislative proposal or amendment that is being considered by the Ways and Means and Education and Workforce committees. The language suggests that this proposal is still in the drafting stage and has not yet been finalized or adopted. As such, it could be argued that the information is part of the agencies' deliberative process and therefore exempt from disclosure under FOIA.; ; However, it is worth noting that FOIA exemptions are not absolute and must be balanced against the public interest in disclosure. In this case, there may be a strong public interest in understanding the details of this proposal, particularly given its potential impact on minimum wage laws and workers' rights. As such, even if the information is technically exempt under FOIA, agencies may still choose to release it in the interest of transparency and accountability.

D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; We continue to work on clarifying the intent of the Family Violence Option and making it a useful tool for the states to help families escape violence and poverty in a meaningful way. As you may know, a Sense of Congress on Family Violence Option Clarifying Amendment is included in the House Budget Resolution working its way through Congress. This amendment delineates the intent of Congress when passing the Family Violence Option as part of last year’s welfare bill. Although the Budget Resolution is not a binding piece of legislation, it shows bipartisan support for the FVO in the broadest sense, and we believe it should be sufficient to instruct the Administration in its regulatory process and in its communications to the states.	Yes, this could potentially be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language used in the passage suggests that there may be ongoing discussions or deliberations within the agency about how to interpret and implement the Family Violence Option, and that these discussions may involve sensitive or confidential information.

Currently, many states are hesitant to elect the FVO for fear of economic sanctions. Ifthe imprecise wording of the Family Violence Option in last year’s welfare bill is the stumbling block to a lucid interpretation of this option, then the answer is this Congressional technical clarification. It is imperative that this Administration, with its reputation as a friend to battered women, step forward and support this clarification.

Voters’ initial suppor for coverage doubtless arises from a fundamental sense of faimess. Since other workers receive this protection, they reason, why shouldn't workfare participants in similar jobs? However, organized labor has another, less immediately obvious reason for believing that coverage is needed — namely, the corrosive effect that sub-minimum-wage workfare programs could have on the jobs and wages of low-wage workers outside of workiare programs. The survey tested the appeal of this argument for coverage against a powerful opposition case that focuses on the cost of coverage to taxpayers, and finds the wage impact argument prevails by a decisive two to one margin.

Scheduling recommends either August 14 or 15th and Eli has recommended the following cities: St. Louis, Indianapolis, Columbus, and Baltimore. (Second tier choices would be Portland, Denver, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Atlanta). At first glance, Ann thought St. Louis would be the best.

Scheduling has regretted the NCSL request already, but Intergovernmental and Scheduling are supportive of revisiting it as a satellite. DLC still wants the President to lead a roundtable discussion on welfare to work, which | think he would enjoy, so they proposed to Christa perhaps having that panel here at the White House and satellite the President's opening remarks to Philadelphia.

It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If there were internal discussions or deliberations within the agency about the development of this tax credit proposal, those communications could potentially be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure.

She is a weaith of information about what's going on in U.K. re: welfare reform, having recently led a group of high level British officials on a tour to NY, Washington, St Louis and Milwaukee and spending several weeks in Britain learning about what they are doing. She says that the most immediate focus is a 'New Deal’ for 18-24 year olds, starting in 12 pilot sites in January and going national in April. The program targets unemployed youth who will be called in once they have received assistance for 6 months. They will come into a job center, meet with a 'New Deal' advisor, get andassessment, and if determined job ready, go to work. If not, they will go through 12 weeks officialsStrive-like job readiness, including assessment for substance abuse and learning disabilities, then goingto one of four steps: unsubsidized job, long-term training, voluntary sector sort of like workingexperience), or work in the environmental! sector.

At the same time, she says Blair et al remain very interested in how to operate effective job centers and private sector involvement. Se®Ms to me the quéStion is to what extent we want to highlight the youth issue, since the population the Brits are targeting is not really a primary focus of our welfare reform initiatives.

This was supported by Blair, Social Security secretary Harriet Harman, and Chancellor Gordon Brown. Apparently this was necessary to meet the budget targets set by the Tory Government. The proposal created a major revolt by Labour backbenchers, leading to several resignations, and 47 Labour MPs voting against the proposal. Blair and Brown justified their position as one of the ‘hard choices’ that Labour must make, demonstrating a commitment to live within tough spending limits and consistent with weaning single parents from welfare to work. As part of the package, Brown announced a new child care program and a “New Deal"" jobs program to help people move into work.

The goal is to place 2,500 welfare recipients over the next 27 months. The project has been operating for several months. Small businesses notify the Job Connection (via a 1-800 number) when they have a vacancy. The Job Connection geocodes the job location, and provides geocoded information about nearby supportive services, i.e. child care and transportation.

The state feels it has successfully gone through the culture change to work first (confirmed in a recent Abt evaluation). It is now dealing with the next stage, i.e. what happens once someone gets a job and leaves welfare.

The state is about to award $5 million in ‘barrier busting’ grants to localities, with about 85% of the grants focusing on transportation.

D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; FLORIDA Staff in the Governor's Washington office is exploring potential initiatives sites with state staff and will get back to us by the end of the week with some ideas. They have suggested coordinating the State WAGES board (the private/public board governing the program) as well as the local WAGES coalition wherever we might want to visit. Generally, Florida's welfare reform program is thoughtful, well managed, relatively mature. One interesting item that I'm getting more information about--they have evidence of improved school performance of children whose parents went to work through welfare reform.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. The communication appears to be an internal discussion between staff members in the Governor's office, and it contains information about potential initiatives and coordination efforts related to Florida's welfare reform program. This type of communication is likely considered privileged because it involves the development of policy and decision-making processes within the executive branch. Additionally, the mention of evidence related to improved school performance could be considered deliberative and therefore protected under exemption 5.

D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Just a heads up...| ran into Nicholas, public policy editor for the Financial Times of London, at the NGA policy forum last week. He mentioned that he was working through Dan Balz of  the Washington Post to try to get an interview on welfare reform, and said Balz had contacted Bruce. Apparently Timmins had arranged an interview for Balz with Tony Blair or some high level British official and now Balz is trying to reciprocate. Timmins is spending several months studying and writing about welfare reform in the U.S. Without revealing anything about the upcoming Blair visit, | took the opportunity to ask Nicholas about what's going on with welfare reform in the U.K.	This would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.

D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; RADIO ADDRESS You will announce that we are sending our America Reads legislation to the Hill, and use that opportunity to emphasize AmeriCorps’ role in America Reads. You can also talk about your vision of the Summit and highlight America Reads as a great example of meeting the Summit’s challenge on volunteering, tutoring, and literacy. In addition, you can announce that Federal agencies are making a “commitment” to the Summit that they will expand the number of schools that they have adopted or established partnerships with from approximately 1,500 schools to 2,000 schools by the year 2000. Working through partnerships established by their agencies, Federal employees tutor, purchase equipment, and hold career days.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. The language in the passage suggests that it is discussing internal strategy and planning related to the America Reads legislation and the Summit, which would likely be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. Additionally, the passage references commitments made by federal agencies, which could also be considered privileged communications related to internal decision-making.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; MONDAY SPEECH AT SUMMIT When you laid out your original vision of national service back in 1992, you set forth two fundamental principles that captured the public imagination: first, that all young Americans willing to give something back should have the chance to get help for college; and second, that we should challenge those young people to help solve our toughest problems, “as teachers, police officers, child care workers -- doing work our country desperately needs,” as you said in the first Georgetown speech.	No, the given text would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. The given text does not contain any such communication and is a public speech given by a public figure. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; AmeriCorps, though still a well-kept secret, has gone a long way toward realizing your overall ideal of citizen service. But for budgetary and partisan political reasons, it will not become universal anytime soon, and because of its decentralized structure, AmeriCorps has not succeeded in marshaling a nation-wide effort to target a compelling national problem like education or crime.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be part of a decision-making process. It is a statement about the success and limitations of AmeriCorps, which is not related to the exemption.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Your speech in Philadelphia is a chance to breathe new life into that original ideal. We can’t escape the budgetary constraints, but we can give more young people an incentive to serve, and most important, we can set forth a clear national mission of the problems we need them to solve.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be part of a decision-making process. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The following proposal are designed with that in mind. 1. Interest-free Year of Service As you know, Rev. Tony Campolo has urged you to make it easier for college students and recent graduates to take a year off for service. Thanks to your income-contingent loan program and to earlier changes allowing loan deferments for service, students can already take advantage of reduced loan payments if they take low-paying service jobs, and can take time off for service without having to begin repayment of their loans. Your FY98 budget also includes a proposal to encourage service by no longer treating loan forgiveness as taxable income, so that students who universities forgive their loans will no longer have to pay taxes on it.	It is possible that this proposal could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. The proposal appears to be a recommendation made to a government agency, and it is possible that it contains internal deliberations or advice that could be considered privileged. However, without more information about the context and origin of the proposal, it is difficult to say for certain whether it would be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The only remaining barrier is the interest that accumulates on unsubsidized loans during the period of service. The cost of having the Federal government pay that interest is minimal -- $7 million over 5 years. This is an inexpensive proposal, and the typical benefit is not enormous, but it would make this policy universal, and it would allow any young person to take time off to serve without increasing his or her debt burden. The Education Department has expressed some concerns about this.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The passage appears to be discussing internal deliberations within the Education Department about a proposed policy, and as such, it would likely be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 2. Police Corps  You can announce $20 million in grants to 17 states for the Police Corps program. The Police Corps was created in your 1994 Crime Bill to increase the number of community police officers with advanced education and training, and was one of your pledges during the 1992 presidential campaign. :	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The announcement of grants for the Police Corps program is a public statement and does not involve any privileged or confidential communications. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The Police Corps offers educational assistance to qualified college students who commit to enter the police after graduation and serve in the force for at least four years. Students accepted into the Police Corps receive up to $7,500 in educational assistance for up to four years of undergraduate study. In addition, Corps recruits receive 16 weeks of rigorous training to help make them effective community police officers. As an incentive to police departments to take recruits, state and local law enforcement agencies receive cash assistance for employing Police Corps officers -- $10,000 per participant for each year of the recruit’s service.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the passage is factual and does not involve any privileged or confidential communications. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; This announcement nearly triples the number of states that will receive Police Corps funds, from 6 to 17 states, and is double the funding appropriated in FY 1996 for the program. It will fund about 650 recruits. Your FY 1998 budget contains $20 million in funding for Police Corps.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the statement is factual and does not involve any privileged or confidential communications.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 3. Teacher Corps We believe your Summit speech should include a ringing call to service for young people to teach in inner cities. Nothing would do more to breathe new life into the ethic of service than to enlist young Americans in a national effort to transform inner-city schools that are crying out for their energy, idealism, and talent.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement about a call to service for young people to teach in inner cities is not a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it contain privileged information.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; One way to do this would be to announce the proposal described below, which provides $400 million over four years in incentives for approximately 48,000 new teachers. If this seems too costly to propose in the current budget environment, it could be ramped up more slowly at about half the cost and impact. You could also propose a more modest expansion of AmeriCorps’ support for Teach for America, as long as we also address quality concerns about that program. Alternatively, your speech could simply include a strong call to young people to take up the challenge of teaching in inner cities without proposing a new initiative to provide federal support. Such an initiative could still be included in the Administration’s Higher Education Act proposal, which will be transmitted this summer.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. The proposal described in the passage may be part of internal deliberations and decision-making processes, and therefore could be considered privileged. However, it ultimately depends on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the creation and dissemination of this information.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Over the next decade, the nation will need to hire some 2.3 million teachers. Of these, approximately 15%, or 345,000 (approximately 35,000 per year), will be hired in central cities, in schools with large concentrations of low income students. An additional 207,000 (approximately 20,000 per year) will be needed in isolated, and often poor, rural areas. These types of communities face the greatest difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified teachers. Urban areas in particular receive significantly fewer applications for positions than neighboring suburban districts, and attrition rates in urban areas can often reach 30% to 50% in the first five years. They are therefore most likely to fill classroom vacancies with teachers who lack preparation, don’t meet licensure requirements, or who are teaching outside their field. As a result, the students in these communities -- who need the most qualified teachers in order to meet higher academic standards -- often get exactly the opposite in the classroom.	"No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to materials that are ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" The passage provided does not appear to be an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letter, and it does not contain any information that would be exempt from disclosure under this exemption."
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; We propose a new national effort to help attract and retain teachers in high poverty central city and rural schools. This new initiative would be a part of the Administration’s proposal for the reauthorization of Title V of the Higher Education Act. The basic framework for this initiative could be announced at the summit, while many of the details could be further  developed by the Education Department over the coming months.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. The statement provided is a proposal for a new national effort and does not involve any inter-agency or intra-agency communication. Additionally, it does not appear to be pre-decisional or deliberative in nature, as it is a proposal for a new initiative rather than a discussion of potential options or alternatives. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; This initiative would provide competitive grants to 100 local partnerships involving urban or rural school districts and institutions of higher education, to be used to provide incentives for individuals to prepare to teach, and to remain, in underserved schools. These would include 2-3 year fellowships for undergraduate students (including for a “Sth year” program that provides intensive and sustained classroom experience for undergraduates after they have acquired a strong liberal arts background); one-year graduate fellowships for post-baccalaureate students, including recent liberal arts graduate and mid-career professionals seeking to enter teaching; stipends for teachers’ aides and other education.paraprofessionals seeking to move up a career ladder into full teaching positions; and 1-2 year “residencies” for beginning teachers that would provide a lighter teaching load coupled with additional time for class preparation, being coached or mentored, or working in other ways with more experienced teachers.	It is possible that this initiative could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the initiative was developed through internal agency deliberations and contains pre-decisional or deliberative information, it may be exempt from disclosure. However, if the initiative has already been implemented or finalized, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this initiative is exempt from FOIA would depend on the specific circumstances surrounding its development and implementation.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The incentives would range from fellowships that cover tuition and fees (which average $3,500 at undergraduate public institutions) to forgivable loans to salary supplements for beginning teachers. Successful competitors would have to demonstrate that they have a high quality teacher preparation program, and that the program fits into a comprehensive, thoughtful strategy for recruiting and retaining teachers.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or contain deliberative process material. The statement provided does not fall under this category as it does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency. It is a general statement about incentives for teacher preparation programs and does not contain any privileged or deliberative information.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The Education Department proposes to fund this initiative at $100 million a year for five years, beginning with the FY1999 budget. The Education Department estimates that this initiative will help attract and retain at least 48,000 teachers into high poverty central city and rural schools. This is approximately 17% of the estimated need in those communities. This is not an issue for this year’s appropriations battles, and we have not tried to identify a specific offset. However, it will compete with your other discretionary priorities in the out-years. If you wish to proceed, we will work with OMB to determine what funding level we can commit to right now, recognizing that the parameters of NDD spending may change before we submit the FY99 budget.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language used in this passage suggests that it is part of an internal agency communication, discussing budget priorities and potential funding levels. As such, it would likely be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; We are also exploring ways to link this initiative to AmeriCorps, which already provides scholarships (but no stipends) to 1,000 teachers in Teach for America. As you know, Teach for . America has been fairly successful in capturing the imagination of the public and of college students, but to this point has not provided the preparation and support those new teachers need to succeed in the classroom and remain in the profession. We could use existing scholarship funds to expand AmeriCorps’ commitment to Teach for America, but we should also look for ways to make sure that preparation needs are addressed.	This statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement does not appear to fall under either of those categories and is not related to any privileged or confidential communication.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 4. Child Care Corps You could also announce that you will expand AmeriCorps to include a new child care corps. The child care field has great difficulty attracting and retaining qualified workers, especially well-educated and trained workers who can go on to become leaders in the field. Your recent conference on early learning was the latest confirmation that it is critical to increase the quality of child care. Yet very few of our most talented young people enter this field.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement about expanding AmeriCorps to include a new child care corps is a policy proposal and not a communication related to the decision-making process. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The program would offer AmeriCorps scholarships to individuals who agree to work in child care in low-income areas for two years. It would be open both to those currently working in the field and to those seeking to enter. Members of the corps would not get a stipend from AmeriCorps, but a scholarship of $4,725 a year for two years, which could be used either to repay existing student loans or to pay for further education. Some of these scholarships could be earmarked to help people leaving welfare to get college training to become child care workers.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in this statement does not fall under any of the categories protected by exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The Corporation for National Service estimates that it could support a corps of 2,000 people a year without any increase in their budget or permission from Congress, as long as these individuals get only scholarships and not stipends as well. Under pressure from members of Congress to reduce the cost of an AmeriCorps member, the Corporation has begun to emphasize these “scholarship only” awards, and its scholarship trust fund has excess funds.	Yes, this information could potentially be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The Corporation for National Service may argue that this information is part of their internal deliberative process, as it relates to their decision-making on how to allocate resources and respond to pressure from Congress. However, it is ultimately up to a court to determine whether this exemption applies in a given case.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Non-profit groups would apply to become part of this program, and would have to demonstrate that they could offer participants high-quality training and mentoring during their two years of service, including development of management and leadership skills. In addition, corporations could sponsor members by paying for their salaries, and universities that specialize in early childhood education could match our scholarships.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement provided does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it involve any decision-making process. It simply outlines the requirements for non-profit groups to participate in a program, as well as potential sponsorship options from corporations and universities.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 5. Mentoring/Tutoring 1 Million Kids In preparation for the Summit, Federal agencies have joined their counterparts in the private and non-profit sectors by making public “commitments” to the goals of the Summit. Agencies have identified over 40 initiatives where they will work with partners in the volunteer or service sectors to mentor and tutor kids, expand afterschool programs, and offer young people opportunities to serve. We are trying to determine whether these commitments add up to an additional 1 million kids being mentored or tutored as a result of Federal government efforts.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications, such as those between an attorney and client or those containing trade secrets. The information provided in this statement does not fall under any of the categories protected by exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; FIRST LADY SPEECH AT CLOSING CEREMONY The First Lady will represent the Administration at the closing ceremony on Tuesday. We are exploring the option that she could announce Kaiser Permanente’s commitment of $100 million over the next five years to provide health coverage to 50,000 children in California.	The information in this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not involve any such communication and is simply a statement about the First Lady's upcoming appearance and a potential announcement. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Police youth academies are active in many Communities across the country.' The structure and participants vary greatly from program to program, but each one is structured around creating constructive interactions between police and young people. Most of the existing  Programs are co-sponsored by law enforcement agencies and schools or community groups, including Kiwanis, YMCA, scouting organizations, and business groups.	No, the information provided would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided pertains to police youth academies, which are not government agencies and do not involve privileged communications.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Components of Police Youth Academies Current academies contain some or all of the following program elements:  - basic orientation to law enforcement (arrest procedures, search procedures, ethics) ~ physical fitness and sports; - orientation to law enforcement as a career (challenges, responsibilities); - conflict resolution and dealing with peer pressure; - role-playing exercises for police-youth interactions; - field trips to jails, courts, training facilities, etc.; - antigang and drug programs; - building self-esteem and attitude management; - tutoring.	It is possible that some of the components of police youth academies could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications and deliberative process. However, it would depend on the specific context and content of the information being requested. ; ; For example, if the request was for internal communications or documents related to the development or evaluation of the program elements, those materials could potentially be protected under exemption 5. This might include emails or memos discussing the effectiveness of certain components, or drafts of program materials that were not ultimately used. ; ; On the other hand, if the request was simply for a list of the program elements that are typically included in police youth academies, it is less likely that exemption 5 would apply. This information is relatively factual and does not involve the kind of privileged or deliberative communications that exemption 5 is intended to protect. ; ; Overall, the applicability of exemption 5 would depend on the specific information being requested and the context in which it was created or used.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Structure and Participants The range for participant ages varies from elementary school students (Delray, FL Kids and COPS Academy and Dekalb County, GA Junior Police Academy) to high school-level and older (NYPD Youth Academy, Howard County, MD Youth Police Academy). Some programs are structured as periodic after-school or evening programs (Dayton, OH Youth Police Academy) or month-long summer programs (Enfield, CT), while others are more intensive, Los Angeles has considered a full-time magnet-like high school program modeled on a youth police academy.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the passage does not fall under this category and would likely be releasable under FOIA.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Some programs allow any interested young person to apply. Some programs are adjuncts to other programs (such as the Boy Scouts’ Police Explorer program), and thus participants are drawn from that pool. Others base participation on referrals from teachers, school officials or the police themselves in light of disciplinary matters or minor skirmishes with police.	No, the information provided would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process privilege.

D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Current Availability of Federal Funding There does not appear to be a realistic prospect of committing any FY 97 J ustice resources to directly support police youth academies. Although the Bureau of Justice Assistance was appropriated a relatively small amount of truly discretionary funding, BJA already has issued program plans and solicitations that account for all of the available funding.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language used in the document suggests that it is an internal communication discussing the availability of federal funding, which could be considered privileged information. Additionally, the document appears to be discussing ongoing agency decision-making processes, which could also be considered privileged.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?

D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The Law Enforcement Scholarships and Recruitment Act, 42 U.S.C. § 14111 et seq, passed as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, authorizes funds to be provided to states to pay costs of part-time or summer employment for high school juniors and seniors which consists of “performing meaningful tasks that inform students of the nature of the tasks performed by law enforcement agencies.” Although none of the police youth academy programs that we have identified currently provides paid employment to its participants, one could design an academy-type program building on a job assignment of some sort. No funds have been appropriated to implement the Law Enforcement Scholarships and Recruitment Act to date. Moreover, the authorization of appropriations provision states that of funds appropriated for this Act, only 20% may be used to provide employment, while 80% must be used to provide scholarships for career law enforcement officers.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials.

D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Other Considerations While many of the police youth academies currently in operation appear to be popular and successful, it is our perception that a decision to make federal funding of police youth academies a priority would be greeted at best skeptically by police management and labor  organizations, and most likely with some degree of resentment or hostility 6; expeciations that already exist for the use of Crime Act funding, We currently are facine ene g. We currently are facing significant unmet demand for funding to support more “core” law enforcement o erations, such as for technology, continuation of expiring domestic violence iniiatives, and forthe law enforcement scholarshyy described above. In addition, the past and current appropriations for the Police Corps program, while the Law Enforcement Scholarship program remains unfunded, has engendered  dissatisfaction from many quarters in law enforcement that would be exacerbated by funding additional programs not benefiting police more directly.	Yes, this passage could potentially be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The passage discusses internal deliberations and considerations regarding the allocation of federal funding for police youth academies, including potential skepticism, resentment, and hostility from police management and labor organizations.

Nobody here, including me,thinks the President will be satisfied with or well served by simply talking about options and appointing a task force to come up with a plan. This approach will fail to capitalize on the incredible media attention at the summit, and may not sufficiently focus attention on the importance of attracting well prepared people into teaching. Further, we can waste an awful lot of time just appointing and organizing a task force, time which could otherwise be spent fleshing out a legislative proposal and consulting informally and extensively.	This would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. This communication does not appear to be between agencies or within an agency, and it does not involve the development of a policy or decision.

We would also need to make some assumptions about the size of fellowships, and possible ways of dividing up funds between the three types of prospective teachers described above, so that we could estimate a range of teacher slots that would be filled through this initiative.	The passage would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The passage appears to be discussing internal deliberations and planning related to a potential program announcement by the President, which could be considered pre-decisional and deliberative.

D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; On the cost per AmeriCorps member, here is some info: @ Average cost per AmeriCorps member for fiscal year 1996 -- $17,629. e Agreement with Grassley will reduce that to $17,000 for fiscal year 1997; $16,000 for fiscal year 1998; and $15,000 by fiscal year 1999.	Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The information appears to be part of an agreement between the agency and Senator Grassley, and therefore may be considered privileged communication. Additionally, the information relates to the agency's budget and financial information, which may also be protected under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; e Most of that goes directly to the AmeriCorps member (or a school on his/her behalf): ® $6,700 toward a living allowance of $7,600, with the remainder raised by the local sponsor @ $1,200 for barebones health insurance coverage and to assist a few members with child-care costs e@ $4,725 for an education voucher upon completion of at least 1,700 hours of direct service Total Corporation-funded benefits per member: about $12,625.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications, such as those between an attorney and client or those that would reveal the agency's decision-making process. The information provided in the statement is factual and does not fall under any of the categories protected by exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; e@ Remainder pays for: ® governor-appointed bipartisan commissions that run annual statewide competitions among local nonprofit groups wishing to sponsor AmeriCorps members @ equipment, materials, recruitment, training, and oversight-costs that are being cut as part of the reform agreement with Grassley @ the Corporation	"The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The statement appears to be discussing internal deliberations and decisions related to the funding and oversight of AmeriCorps programs, which would likely be considered privileged information. Additionally, the mention of a ""reform agreement with Grassley"" suggests that the information may be part of ongoing negotiations or discussions with external parties, further supporting its classification as privileged."
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; He wrote about deferral. The President responded in March {Mike Cohen wrote it) that deferments are in fact alréady available, and that the Department would send him some information on that. We then scoured the area for what more we could do, and came up with this. | am trying to reach Campolo in Hawaii to see what he thinks.	It is unclear whether the passage would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any information related to deliberative processes or privileged communications. The passage appears to be a factual account of actions taken by the author and the President in response to a request for information on deferrals. The mention of attempting to contact Campolo in Hawaii does not appear to be related to any privileged communication or deliberative process. Therefore, it is unlikely that this passage would be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; (FYI, Bill Kincaid says reporters are calling the Dept. of Education asking if it's true that the President is going to come out in support of mandatory service requirements at the Summit.)	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement appears to be a third-party communication and does not involve any privileged or deliberative information.
D0//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; {Also FYI, Teach for America now stands at 2,200 members. According to Gomperts, Eli ""rescued"" the program 2 years ago.)"	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided does not fall under any of these categories and is simply a factual statement about Teach for America and its recent history.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Which did Campolo have in mind? Deferral or forgiveness?	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. The statement in question does not fall under this category as it does not involve any inter-agency or intra-agency communication or deliberation. It is a simple question that does not reveal any internal decision-making processes.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Bruce -- note well that (as | understand it) this proposal is not to defer, but to forgive the year's worth of interest.	The following statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, the statement provided does not involve any inter-agency or intra-agency communication, nor does it involve any deliberative process. It is a simple statement made by an individual and does not reveal any internal government decision-making. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; On student loans and service, here's the story. There are 4 types of breaks on student loans you can offer people who serve.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. The statement provided does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it contain any deliberative information that would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. It is a general statement about student loans and service, which does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 1. Income contingency -- We did this in 1993. It says that if you can take a low-paying service job, your loan payments will be only a limited percentage of your income, and ultimately forgiven after 25 years.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process privilege. The information provided in the statement is not related to any inter-agency or intra-agency communication and does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D1//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 2. Loan deferment -- This predates us. It is used when (1) someone wants to take time off during school but doesn't want to have to start paying back loans during that time; or (2) someone finishes school, but argues they have a good reason they don't want to start paying back their loans. You can get a deferment for up to 3 years. You are eligible if you are unemployed, or if it would create an ""economic hardship,” which includes service. There is no separate service deferment. There used to be, but the system got so complex that it was simplified in 1992."	"No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" The information provided in this passage does not appear to be an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letter, nor does it appear to be related to litigation. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5."
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 3. Subsidize all loan deferments for service-- This is our new idea. This means that no interest accumulates on loans during the period of service. We already do this for subsidized loans, which are about 2/3 of the volume, so this would fix unsubsidized loans and make it universal.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be part of a decision-making process. It is a proposal for a new policy or program.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The $7 million cost over five years would allow 12,000 borrowers with unsubsidized loans to get this benefit during their deferment. The average benefit would be $600. This estimate assume that no one is induced to serve. If the program cost doubled to $14 million because the subsidized deferment would be more attractive, the number of beneficiaries would increase to 24,000, each receiving $600.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the statement does not fall under this category and is therefore not protected under exemption 5.
D1//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; In answer to your question as to whether we could do this for more than one year of service: This cost estimate already assumes that this could be for up to 3 years. The estimate simply reflects historical data on people who request a deferment due to economic hardship for ""service-related"" reasons, so it is a mix of people requesting 1, 2, and 3 years of deferments. |.don't think we would want to go past the 3 year point."	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be an internal discussion about policy and decision-making, and disclosing it could potentially harm the agency's ability to make informed decisions in the future. Additionally, the statement does not appear to contain any information that would be of significant public interest or benefit.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 4. Tax Incentives for Student Loan Forgiveness - This is our existing legislative proposal. It says loan forgiveness for service reasons by non-profit charitable or educational institutions should not be taxable. Loan forgiveness by public institutions is already not taxable if it is for service reasons.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This proposal is a legislative proposal, not a communication between agencies or within an agency. Therefore, it would not fall under exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; FYI, you will recall that | had been pushing a draft presidential directive to encourage agencies to Implement flexible work schedules to allow fedefel employees to volunteer. Thad an OPM draft circulating, in the hopes it would be ready in time for the summit. However, OMB just informed me that the Labor Dept. has raised a major policy objection to it, saying that it is bad timing with the alternative work schedule bill S4 we are fighti ublicans over on the Hill, and that it would give ammunition to those we are fighting. | haven't had much time to focus on the merits of this objection, figuring this was probably the death knell for this idea, but | can pursue if you want me to.	The passage would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The passage discusses internal deliberations and policy objections related to a draft presidential directive, which would likely be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. Additionally, the passage contains references to ongoing political battles and strategy, which could also be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The Corporation is touting an alternative to the Teach for America model that they fund based at Notre Dame. For what it's worth, here's the details: .	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process privilege. The given information does not fall under any of these categories and is not related to any government agency or its communication. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; After 2 intensive summer trainings, two years of university courses, and full time teaching, members earn a Masters of Arts in education. Matched with a.mentor from that school. Their students do service-learning. 80 members last year; good record with principals.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in this statement does not fall under any of the categories protected by exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Here is how | think we need to proceed in order to have something concrete on rewards/incentives for teaching for the President to announce at the service summit:	As an AI language model, I do not have personal beliefs or opinions. However, the following statement may be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the statement was made by a government official as part of their official duties and falls under the deliberative process privilege, it may be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.; ; The statement appears to be discussing a plan of action related to a policy announcement by the President. It may be considered part of the agency's decision-making process and therefore protected under the deliberative process privilege. However, the specific circumstances and context of the statement would need to be evaluated to determine if it meets the requirements for exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 1. We need a meeting with key ED staff (Mike Smith, and some combination of David Longanaker, Terry Dozier, Terry Peterson, or whoever Mike thinks would be good), OMB (Ken, or Barry White), and NEC {Bob Shireman) to start developing a set of options.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, this statement does not contain any deliberative information or opinions. It is simply a request for a meeting to start developing options, which is administrative in nature and does not involve any decision-making. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 2. Bruce--To get this off to the right start, you need to call Mike Smith. | want him to think from the outset that this is not just another, early run on the higher ed. reauthorization proposal for the sake of an event. (At some point he will figure out that it is a specia/early run on the higher ed reauthorization proposal , but hopefully not till we are further downt he road). A call from you, rather than me, telling him that POTUS really wants to do something concrete at the summit, as part of a larger package on the service professions, and perhaps mentioning Riley's call to you about the Summit last night, will set this in the right context for Mike.	This would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. The language in the message suggests that it is part of a larger strategy or plan, and that disclosing it could harm the government's ability to effectively carry out that plan. Additionally, the mention of POTUS (President of the United States) and Riley (likely a high-ranking government official) suggests that this is a sensitive matter that should be kept confidential.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 3. In addition to the kind of purpose and design issues we discussed last night -- reward vs. incentive, concentrated vs. spread out, etc. -- we need to figure out some budget parameters here. Does ED have room in current/projected budget? How were they going to pay for this part of their proposal anyway? If we go with a legislative initiative as part of higher ed act, which won't pass for at least a year and more likely the end of this session, then the $ won't start flowing until FY 99 or perhaps 2000. Is this a problem, or does it help?	This would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. This is because it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are typically protected under this exemption. Instead, it is a discussion about budget parameters and funding sources, which are not related to the deliberative process of government decision-making.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Let me know if this makes sense to you, and if you call Mike. Or, you may see him in the cabinet mtg.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided does not appear to be an inter-agency or intra-agency communication, nor does it contain any privileged or confidential information.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Can Cathy set up the meeting?	"No, the statement ""Can Cathy set up the meeting?"" would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement in question does not fall under any of these categories and is not related to government agency operations or decision-making."
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; According to Jen Palmieri, the President actually asked to meet with Harris to have a general discussion of some sort on service.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. If the statement was made as part of a confidential conversation between the President and his advisors, it could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, if the statement was made in a public setting or was not part of a privileged conversation, it would not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this statement is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances surrounding its creation and dissemination.
D0//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; | forwarded you a memo Harris sent to the President last week in preparation for this meeting (the one that begins by quoting a 17th century poem, dated January 22). That memo goes beyond service to say that the President's special ""trinity"" of legacy issues are education, service, and race, and that the President should try to show the link between the three -- that they are all about ""one America."" He argues that focusing on the 5. summit goals for children is the way to do this, although | never find that argument totally convincing. Steve Silverman is collecting all the recent Harris missives for the President to review prior to the meeting."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. The memo was sent from Harris to the President and contains advice and recommendations for the President's agenda, which could be considered privileged information. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances and whether the information meets the criteria for exemption 5.
D1//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The links to race seem most promising -- a town hall taking off from the SOTU, with military, Peace pedple together to serve across racial lines. Also, Gomperts has been talking about proposing a “thinkers” conference on service -- to discuss how to bring service ""up to scale"", and to try to find  common ground with ""compassionate conservatives"" like Coates and Kasich who favor tax credits for charitable contributions to support the volunteer sector."	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The passage provided does not appear to be a communication between government agencies or within a government agency, nor does it appear to be part of a decision-making process. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; | still think this is dopey, and we shouldn't waste a lot of time on it Monday. But it might be nice for the President to say something about it on Tuesday, when he has a big mentoring event at the WH. Can you find out if America's Promise expects any major press on this?	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not fall under any of the categories of privileged communications, such as attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. It is simply a communication between individuals discussing a potential event and does not contain any sensitive or confidential information.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; What are the President and Harris meeting about on Friday?	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. If the meeting between the President and Harris involves sensitive or confidential information related to national security, foreign policy, or other matters that fall under executive privilege, then the details of the meeting may be exempt from disclosure under this exemption. However, if the meeting is purely routine or administrative in nature, or if the information discussed is not considered privileged, then it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this information is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances of the meeting and the nature of the information discussed.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Attached is stuff cobbled together from Cabinet Affairs, me, and John Gomperts that will form the basis for the briefing memo on tomorrow's meeting that Cabinet Affairs is putting together.	Yes, the following would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The email appears to contain internal deliberations and discussions between Cabinet Affairs, the author, and John Gomperts, which are likely to be considered privileged and confidential. Additionally, the email refers to a briefing memo for a meeting, which may contain sensitive information that is exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; We asked Gomperts what Harris might bring up. No big surprises (reauthorization, race), but 2 little ones: First, he may raise exempting AmeriCorps education awards from taxation. Today they are treated as income. It would cost about $14 million; it’s not in the budget. We were thinking about putting it in our reauthorization proposal, but Gomperts decided not to because he feared having to refer the bill to hostile tax committees. Second, Harris may propose that we require more work-study jobs to be service. | recall that you have not been enthusiastic about that idea in the past. The Education Dept. and the higher ed community doesn't like the idea, and | know it risks too much pressure when added to America Reads and the college-school partnerships, but | think it has merit on its own. (There is also a disability item he may raise that is still a mystery to me.)	The passage would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The passage appears to be a discussion between individuals within an agency about potential policy proposals and their potential drawbacks. This type of internal deliberation is typically considered privileged and exempt from FOIA disclosure.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The Corporation has accomplished a great deal in the past year, including a growing membership through America Reads and new partnerships with non-profits and faith-based groups; the service summit last April; and the launch of the new high school service scholars program.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement provided does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency that is part of a decision-making process. It is a general statement about the accomplishments of the Corporation.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Reauthorization of the Corporation for National Service: This is the Corporation's top priority for this year, and Harris will ask you for your active assistance. He will ask you to send a strong signal to the bipartisan Congressional leadership and the Chairs and Ranking Members of the authorizing committees, as well as key White House offices, that reauthorization is a high priority for your Administration. One option is to hold an event in the next few weeks when we officially transmit our legislation to the Hill.	"Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The text appears to be discussing strategy and planning related to the reauthorization of the Corporation for National Service, which could be considered a privileged communication between government officials. Additionally, the mention of ""key White House offices"" suggests that this is an internal communication within the executive branch, which would also be covered by exemption 5."
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Through the service summit and other vehicles, Harris has reached out extensively to Republicans and to those who have not traditionally supported national service in an effort to build bridges between the service and volunteer sectors. While he has made progress, it is not clear which Republicans have joined our cause and would agree to speak out on behalf of reauthorization. General Powell has done PSA's for AmeriCorps and speaks very positively about the program, but he might not agree to endorse legislation. Harris would like to reach out to the “civic renewal/compassionate conservatives” in Congress such as Sen. Coats to seek ways to work together on citizen service that go beyond AmeriCorps, but which will smooth the path for reauthorization.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of specific individuals and their potential support or endorsement of legislation could be considered privileged information related to internal agency decision-making processes. However, it ultimately depends on the specific circumstances and context of the communication.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Harris may also raise two related items: legislation to exempt AmeriCorps education awards from income tax, and making it more attractive for individuals with disabilities to participate in AmeriCorps. The Corporation decided to drop the tax proposal from its reauthorization proposal late last year because of fears that it would bog down reauthorization. It has a small cost.	Yes, the information would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The discussion of the decision to drop the tax proposal and the reasoning behind it would likely be considered privileged communication between agency officials. Additionally, the mention of the small cost could be considered deliberative process material, which is also protected under exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; One America: Harris wants to follow up on your “One America” theme from the State of the Union, where you spoke about how citizen service can help us create a common identity, and gave as examples the military, the Peace Corps, and AmeriCorps. He will suggest a White House event (either a Conference or other form of interactive event) in which people from the military, the Peace Corps, and especially young people engaged in national service can draw attention to the ways in which their shared endeavors have led to greater understanding across racial and other differences. Obviously, we would want to work with the Race Initiative and others in creating such an event, but we would look to highlight AmeriCorps and other forms of national service (especially youth service) in this event.	It is possible that this communication could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications such as those involving deliberative processes or attorney-client privilege. The mention of working with the Race Initiative and others in creating the event suggests that this communication may involve internal deliberations and discussions about the planning and execution of the event. However, without more context it is difficult to determine whether this communication would meet the requirements for exemption 5 protection.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; In addition, Harris may raise the following issues with you: National Volunteer Week: Harris will want us to highlight National Volunteer Week and National Youth Service Day in April to draw attention to the value of youth service. Like the Martin Luther King Day of Service, this annual event is an occasion to showcase AmeriCorps and national service, and will take place around the time of the one-year anniversary of the service summit in Philadelphia. The Corporation might propose that you serve with AmeriCorps, or that you speak out about programs that encourage and reward youth service such as your high school service scholars program (which we hope to expand to 10,000 high schools this year), or the new President's Student Service Awards.	This would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications. It is simply a discussion of potential issues and proposals related to promoting youth service.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Work Study: Harris may raise the option of dedicating more work-study funds to service. He will acknowledge that the Department of Education and the higher education community are not enthusiastic about this idea, but he feels that work-study could be a key tool to make youth service more universal and build on the success of America Reads.	The passage would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, the passage does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency. It is a statement made by Harris regarding his personal opinion on work-study funds and youth service. It does not contain any deliberative or pre-decisional information that would be protected under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Dear Mr. President, As [ alerted you at Cardozo, this missive is inspired by Andrew Marvel’s 17° century poem about “time’s winged chariot,” and by the realization that you have a little more than a thousand days left in your presidency.

Explain your reasoning.; ; As you may guess, my proposition is that the time has come for you to do everything in your power to roll all your “strength” and all your “sweetness” up into one ball. And that the time to begin trying to do that is your State of the Union address. My pitch goes beyond AmeriCorps and national service — though they are central and the reauthorization for the Corporation for National Service needs your championship in the address to Congress and months to follow. I write here not so much as an agent for AmeriCorps but, if I may be so bold, as a coach for America’s future and for the next thousand days of your Presidency.	This would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications, attorney-client privilege, or deliberative process privilege. It is a letter from an individual to the President, offering advice and suggestions for the State of the Union address and the future of the country. It does not contain any sensitive or confidential information that would warrant exemption from disclosure.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; As an old civil rights hand and a veteran not only of national service, but also of the Peace Corps and higher education over the years, I see you on the brink of truly becoming the Education President, the Citizen Service President, and the President who leads us into the new millennium on the road to One America. The three themes of education, service and One America already run through your record as President and in the years before that. They are three themes that people know run deep in you. They are your special trinity.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. The passage provided does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it contain any deliberative information related to decision-making. It is simply a personal opinion and observation of the writer.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Now is the time, in an even fuller and stronger measure, to roll your efforts in these three vital areas into one commanding vision and one unified strategy. If you succeed, the whole will be recognized as far greater than the sum of the parts. The parts are not small, but so far most people fail to see how they come together in something very powerful and fundamental.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it contain any deliberative information related to a decision-making process.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; As of now, one might predict that historians will acknowledge you as a President who, with indomitable spirit, under unprecedented continuous assault, made progress in many increments on many different fronts. If that is all you did, it would be very good. But what I imagine, and more importantly what the spirit of the nation needs, is far more — that you speak and act in these next three years so you stand tall in history as the one who in the last half of this century ushered in a truly great transformation.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. This passage does not appear to be a communication between government agencies or officials, nor does it contain any deliberative information related to government decision-making. It is simply a personal opinion or suggestion about how the President could be remembered in history.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Roosevelt led such a transformation in the crucible of the Great Depression. Lincoln did it in the Civil War. You can do it in our more complicated time, even though, as you have noted, it is very difficult when there is not an inescapable, galvanizing crisis.	No, the given statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and are part of the decision-making process. The given statement does not fall under this category as it is a general statement made by an individual and does not involve any deliberation or decision-making process.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Yet, as you know, there is a quiet crisis of the American spirit — the civic spirit that made America great. There is the slow-burning crisis of American youth — especially for the 15 million or more who lack the fundamentals for success. There is the profound crisis of American unity — of the two cities of rich and poor, and the divisions of race.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided does not fall under any of these categories and is not related to any government agency communication.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; To galvanize the country for action to deal with this compound crisis, I urge you to embrace the strategy we used to organize the Presidents’ Summit — which is now our strategy in the post-summit campaign for America’s Promise. That is, to focus on the key problems for children and youth and work to bring together all the forces of our society, including citizen service and government at all levels, to solve these problems. And to do it by embracing and giving priority to the measurable goals set at the summit, around which America’s Promise and our national service network are mobilizing people, state-by-state, and community-bycommunity.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it contain any deliberative information that would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. It is a public statement urging action and outlining a strategy for addressing a crisis.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The Five Summit Goals encompass the themes of good education for ail, citizen service for youth and service by all young people, and common work by young and old, across all the lines that divide us, to build One America. The Goals include a healthy start and access to health care for all children, which is also needed to make America one, and for which you have also done so much.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The passage provided does not contain any such privileged communication.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; And the overarching vision is the one you have been articulating so well - One America. It is that vision which connects the three themes. Education is the great equalizer, but to achieve One America that succeeds in self-government, it must be education in the full sense, not just in the classroom and in training for jobs. It must also be education in citizenship, in the ethic and practice of citizen service.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This passage does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency related to decision-making. It is a statement of a vision and a philosophy, not a discussion of policy options or decisions.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Morally and strategically this focus on children and youth, on their education and on service to and by youth, is the right strategy for our time. It is a common ground on which people of common sense can rally for the common good.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided does not fall under any of these categories and is not related to any government agency communication.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; When Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were killed the goals set by the Summit were the ones they were pointing to. The nation has paid a terrible price in not achieving those goals for millions of young people who came of age in the last thirty years. If you use the Bully Pulpit of the Presidency, with all your extraordinary power of persuasion, you can make the next years the beginning of Civil Rights II.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be part of a decision-making process. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; In delivering his Dream on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, Martin said, “We have come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now.” And he spelled out our mission: “ Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity for all of God’s children.”	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement is a public speech made by Martin Luther King Jr. and is not part of any agency communication or decision-making process.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The Capitol is not so hallowed a spot, but the State of the Union is the right occasion to summon up the “better angels of our nature.”	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided is a quote from a speech and does not fall under this category.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; You conveyed so well the essence and centrality of this vision and strategy in your from-the-heart, stirring words to the volunteers at Cardozo. You also articulated this clearly in your December interview with the New York Times, when you said your Race Initiative “needs to be seen in the context also of what I have tried to do since I got here on citizen service, the whole idea of AmeriCorps, participating in the Presidents’ Summit on Service, all that.” And your goal in a “larger sense,” you said is, “to create an ethic of service across racial lines so that when we begin this new century and when I leave office and go off into the sunset, the typical American will have at least three opportunities for constructive engagement with people of other races — one at work, one at school, and one in community service working on common problems. So I intend to try to work to sort of integrate all that.”	It is possible that this would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. The language used in the passage suggests that it may be a communication between government officials discussing strategy and policy goals. However, without more context it is difficult to determine whether this communication would meet the requirements for exemption 5 protection.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; With the vision of One America and that strategy for education and service, and with your strong and sustained leadership, I believe you can yet bring this country together around the great, unifying national cause we need.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. This statement does not fall under this category as it is not a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor is it deliberative in nature. It is a statement of opinion and encouragement directed towards an individual.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; FYI, Maria Echaveste has been pushing for an 800 number for the state of the union where the President could refer people who want to volunteer, in connection with the race initiative. The Corporation for National Service told her it couldn't do this, particularly on such short notice, but suggested creating a Corp. web site that would point potential volunteers to existing web sites of the United Way, the big youth service group, United Way, America's Promise, etc. So we'll see. (Previously, Maria tried to get religious orgs to agree to offer service opportunities, but didn't get much response.)	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of Maria Echaveste's efforts and the response from the Corporation for National Service could be considered internal agency communications that are protected from disclosure. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances and context of the communication.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; | hear that Communications may push to do the radio address on MLK Day and service. Since we have the service project on Monday, that may be overkill, so I'm certainly not pushing it. But, if it becomes the best option, here are my best policy announcements {they're pretty small):	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The text appears to be a communication between individuals within a government agency discussing potential policy announcements and the scheduling of a radio address on a national holiday. This type of internal communication is typically considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 1. President's Youth Service Awards -- The Corporation i i h these; | sent you a note on this the other day. But the First Lady may be planning to announce this in her column, so we'd have to call that off.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of the First Lady's column suggests that this information is part of internal agency deliberations and may be considered privileged. Additionally, the fact that the Corporation has already communicated with the requester about this topic suggests that it is not a matter of public record.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 2. AmeriCorps has a study it hasn't formally released on diversity in AmeriCorps. It's pretty boring -- qualitative stuff about who benefits from diversity and how to support diversity. More interesting is a PC how-to manual by the study authors with examples from successful service programs. The Corporation's conclusion from the study is that national service gives participants a greater respect for others. :	The PC how-to manual with examples from successful service programs would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 because it is not a predecisional or deliberative document. It is a practical guide based on the conclusions of the study. However, the study itself may be protected under exemption 5 if it is considered predecisional or deliberative. The qualitative information about diversity and how to support it could be seen as part of the Corporation's decision-making process and therefore exempt from disclosure. The conclusion that national service gives participants a greater respect for others may also be protected if it is considered part of the Corporation's decision-making process.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 3. The Presidential Memorandum asking agencies to report on how they support employees to want to volunteer during the work day is about to go out.	Yes, the Presidential Memorandum asking agencies to report on how they support employees to want to volunteer during the work day would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This memorandum is likely a communication between the President and agencies, and as such, may contain privileged information that is exempt from disclosure under FOIA. Additionally, the memorandum may contain pre-decisional or deliberative information, which is also protected under exemption 5.
D1//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 4. We could see if Harris is comfortable announcing a ""Saturdays of service"" program for AmeriCorps NCCC, similar to CityYear's Young Heroes, where AmeriCorps and JH students work together on Saturdays."	Yes, this statement could potentially be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The statement suggests a discussion or planning of a potential program, which could be considered a pre-decisional communication. Additionally, the statement involves coordination between AmeriCorps and JH students, which could be considered deliberative in nature. However, it ultimately depends on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the statement.
T0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; I think this is an easy call, but let me know asap if the following raises any red flags.	As an AI language model, I do not have the context to determine whether the information provided would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process privilege. Without knowing the content of the information provided, it is impossible to determine whether it would fall under this exemption.
T0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Harris sent a Dec. 31 memo to the President in which he says the Corporation will relaunch the President's Youth Service Awards. These awards are essentially a certificate similar to the Président's Physical Fitness Award, and would go to any youngster who could demonstrate that they completed 100 hours ice ina year (part of the summit's goal 5). There is no cost. The program has bipartisan support. But it was suspended in March 1994 after a negative IG report on how it was being administered.	The information in this memo would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The memo does not appear to contain any privileged legal advice or deliberative process information. It is simply a description of a program being relaunched and its history. Therefore, it would likely be subject to release under FOIA.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Apparently Gomperts told Melanne about the idea, and my second-hand information is that she liked it very much and the First Lady is seriously considering mentioning it in this week's column, which has a deadline of Thursday. So if there are any problems, we should surface them now.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of the First Lady's column suggests that this information may have been discussed within the White House or another government agency, and the fact that it was shared second-hand could indicate that it was part of an internal discussion or deliberation. However, without more context it is difficult to say for certain whether this information would qualify for exemption 5 protection.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; {The other obvious question is whether we should hold this for him to announce at the service event on MLK Day, but this doesn't seem so appeating, and it's not clear we want an announcement.)	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, this statement does not involve any agency communication or decision-making process. It is simply a discussion about whether or not to make an announcement at a service event. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Here's a draft memo on Harris's proposal to resume the Dail i i s. Let me know whether you want the memo to come from you, and whether you want to recommend an option -| know you've said you really don't care in the past. Steve Silverman would probably be willing to send the memo if you don't want to.	The content of the memo does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. This memo appears to be a draft discussing a proposal to resume the Dail i i s, and does not contain any pre-decisional or deliberative information. It is simply discussing logistics and who should send the memo. Therefore, it would not be exempt from FOIA disclosure.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; This draft identifies a middle ground option between resuming and not resuming the awards, which is resuming them but not linking them to the President. It's been hard to get closure on where people are on this issue, but I think Ann Lewis opposes it, while Steve Silverman thinks we should do something here. Harris says that the former President will be very disappointed if we reject this idea.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The draft appears to be an internal communication discussing potential options and opinions on a sensitive issue, and the opinions expressed by individuals within the agency are likely considered privileged. Additionally, the mention of the former President's potential disappointment could be seen as a confidential communication between the agency and the former President.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Background: Harris Wofford has written to urge that you resume former President Bush’s “ Daily Points of Light” awards. He proposes to rename the awards the “Presidents’ [plural] Points of Light,” with you and President Bush as co-sponsors. Rather than having the White House take responsibility for selecting and vetting the winners on a daily basis, as was the case under President Bush, Harris proposes that the Points of Light Foundation and the Corporation for National Service take on this responsibility. The Knights of Columbus have agreed to fund the costs of this program for one year.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The letter appears to be a communication between individuals outside of the government (Harris Wofford and the Knights of Columbus) and the government (the President and the White House), so it may not be considered an agency record. However, if the White House or other government officials were involved in discussions or decisions related to the proposal, those communications could potentially be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, it would depend on the specific circumstances and content of any related communications.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; One factor complicating the decision is that Harris has had extensive conversations with the Points of Light Foundation and with President Bush himself on this proposal. Apparently Harris has made it clear that he favors this idea and that the decision rests with the White House. Harris indicates that President Bush will be deeply disappointed if we decide not to resume the awards.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. The conversations between Harris, the Points of Light Foundation, and President Bush are likely considered privileged and confidential, as they involve internal deliberations and decision-making processes. Additionally, the statement that President Bush would be disappointed if the awards were not resumed could be seen as reflecting his personal views and opinions, which are also protected under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; One other timing issue is that you are scheduled to attend the dedication of President Bush’s library in November. If we decide to reinstate this program, that event would be an opportunity to announce it, especially given the former President’s attachment to the Points of Light program.	This statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, this statement does not involve any deliberative process or decision-making. It is simply a statement about a potential opportunity to announce the reinstatement of a program. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Arguments For: Reinstating the awards is an easy way to keep the issue of service and volunteerism before the public on a daily basis. It would continue to repair the rift between the AmeriCorps concept of service and the more traditional volunteer sector, just as the Philadelphia summit did. AmeriCorps members would be eligible for the awards.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications. FOIA exemption 5 protects documents that are part of the deliberative process of an agency, such as drafts, recommendations, and opinions. The statement provided is a general argument and does not involve any internal agency communication or decision-making process.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; President Bush very much wants the Administration to do this. He will be very disappointed if we do not, and he will see it as the White House’s decision because of Harris’ conversations with him.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it relate to any decision-making process. It is simply a statement about the President's desires and expectations, which does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Arguments Against: The benefits of resuming the awards are minimal. Our efforts to reach out to the volunteer sector at the Philadelphia summit were so successful that it is not clear what this would add. In addition, some would react negatively to such a decision, since the original Points of Light program was derided by many as an empty gesture.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. However, this statement does not appear to be part of any decision-making process, but rather a statement of opinion or analysis. Therefore, it would not be exempt from FOIA.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The daily responsibility of selecting and vetting winners will be time-consuming for White House staff, and not worth the effort. Although theoretically we could assign responsibility for vetting the award winners to the Points of Light Foundation and the Corporation for National Service, from a practical standpoint we would probably still feel the need to do a legal and/or political check on award winners.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The statement discusses the practical considerations and potential legal and political implications of a decision, which could be considered part of the agency's decision-making process and therefore protected.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Options: Resume the awards as Wofford proposes.	"No, the statement ""Resume the awards as Wofford proposes"" would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process privilege. However, the given statement does not fall under any of these categories and is a straightforward directive or proposal, which does not require any deliberation or decision-making process. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5."
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Decline to resume the awards.	"It is unclear whether the statement ""Decline to resume the awards"" would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. However, this statement does not appear to be a memorandum or letter, nor does it appear to contain any privileged information. Therefore, it is unlikely that it would be protected under exemption 5."
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Reestablish these awards as the “Daily Points of Light” awards, administered by the Corporation and the Points of Light Foundation, with no connection to the President or the White House. It is not clear how President Bush would react to such a plan.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be part of a decision-making process. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Several members of the press are planning stories on progress in the 6 months since the service summit. The Times already did one, and the Boston Globe is working on one that may not be positive; it may already have been in the press this weekend. Jonathan Alter will do one that people suspect will be critical. America's Promise is trying to respond by putting together a 6-month update that Powell will reveal in some setting later this month. They have asked all commitment makers for media-oriented nuggets they could use. (I am putting together a package for them on federal agency commitments.} America's Promisé remains in a state of flux. They still have not developed their tracking system for commitments, and personnel changes continue.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, the information provided in this scenario does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications, nor does it involve the decision-making process of a government agency. It is simply a description of media coverage and efforts by a non-governmental organization to respond to that coverage. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D1//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Steve Silverman and | have talked about us doing a ""6 month memo” that would lay out our own progress since the summit and talk about where we want to be at the 1-year point. Let me know if you think that's a good or bad idea. Ideas we could develop are outreach on health insurance both Medicaid and the new program; and reauthorization of AmeriCorps. You that  Harris just Sent the President a memo -- it's a general update on the Corporation, wit! making reauthorization a priority by releasing it this year and pushing hard early next year"	The passage would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, the passage does not appear to be deliberative in nature, but rather discusses potential future actions and updates on ongoing initiatives. Additionally, the passage does not appear to be an inter-agency or intra-agency communication, but rather a conversation between two individuals. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Folks--this issue has been kicking around and getting more momentum. VA has analyzed over the last few years the claims of these Filipinos for benefits as veterans having fought for the US in WWII. I believe the conclusion is that it would be extremely costly but | don't believe the White House has ever engaged in a substantive analysis of the merits of the claim other than the financial cost. | think we need a process to have this resolved--it has gotten on the President's radar screen. | would be happy to coordinate this process, if you'll assign the appropriate staff members for this work. Thank you.	It is possible that this could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language used in the email suggests that there may have been internal discussions or deliberations about the merits of providing benefits to Filipino veterans, and the email may be considered part of that internal communication. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the email and whether any privileges apply.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; PURPOSE To announce significant budget initiatives to help break the cycle of crime and drugs. A new Justice Department report, also released today, shows that in 1997 more than threequarters of the nation’s prisoners reported past drug use, more than half reported using drugs in the month before their offense, and one in six committed their crimes so they could purchase drugs. Responding to these findings, you will announce new resources to help states and localities systematically test, treat, and sanction drug-involved offenders -including $215 million in the FY 2000 budget to enforce “zero tolerance” for drug use by prisoners, parolees, and probationers.	This announcement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. The announcement is a public statement about budget initiatives and a Justice Department report, and does not involve any internal deliberations or communications between government officials. Therefore, it would not qualify for exemption 5 protection.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; BACKGROUND Today the Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics will release a new study on prisoner drug use (Substance Abuse and Treatment, State and Federal Prisoners, 1997). Key findings regarding prisoner drug use include:	No, the information provided would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are privileged and would not be available to a party in litigation with the agency. The information provided in the background is a summary of a study that will be released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which is a government agency. Therefore, it would not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Vast majority of all prisoners report drug use. In 1997, 83 percent of state prisoners and 73 percent of federal prisoners reported past drug use -considerably more than the 21 percent of state prisoners and 60 percent of federal prisoners who are serving time for drug offenses. In addition, 57 percent of state prisoners and 45 percent of federal prisoners reported using drugs in the month before their arrest.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are privileged and would not be available to a party in litigation with the agency. The information provided in the statement does not appear to be a privileged communication between agencies or within an agency, but rather a statistical report or data. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Many prisoners commit crimes to buy drugs or while high. Nearly 20 percent of state prisoners and 15 percent of federal inmates reported committing their offense to get money to buy drugs. And 33 percent of state prisoners and 22 percent of federal prisoners were actually under the influence of drugs at the time of their offense.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the statement does not fall under any of the categories protected by exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Drug offenders have long “rap sheets.” State prisoners serving sentences for drug offenses reported extensive criminal histories: 76 percent had been previously sentenced to prison or probation; 54 percent were on probation or parole at the time of their arrest; 45 percent had three or more prior sentences, and 23 percent had previously committed a violent crime. Although federal drug offenders generally reported less severe criminal histories, 59 percent had prior criminal records.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the statement does not fall under this category and is not related to any privileged or confidential communication.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; You will announce new measures to ensure that the criminal justice system operates to keep offenders drug- and crime-free, including: (1) $215 million in your FY 2000 budget proposal to drug test and treat more people under criminal justice supervision; and (2) the availability of about $120 million in FY 1999 to help make prisoners and parolees drugfree.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The announcement of new measures and budget proposals related to drug testing and treatment in the criminal justice system does not fall under this exemption.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; (1) $215 million for the most comprehensive drug supervision ever. Your FY 2000 budget will include $100 million to help states and localities implement tough new systems to drug test, treat,and punish prisoners, parolees, and probationers. This initiative will ensure that states fully implement the comprehensive plans to drug test prisoners and parolees that they are required by law to submit to the Justice Department, while also supporting the efforts of states like Maryland and Connecticut to begin drug testing probationers on a regular basis. Your FY 2000 budget also will include $50 million -- or an increase of 25 percent -- to expand the number of local drug courts and $65 million for residential drug treatment in state prisons.	It is possible that some portions of this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. Specifically, any internal discussions or deliberations about the allocation of funds for drug supervision and treatment programs could potentially be exempt from disclosure. However, the actual amounts of money allocated and the general goals of the initiative would likely not be protected under exemption 5, as they do not involve privileged communications. Ultimately, the determination of whether or not this information is exempt from FOIA disclosure would depend on the specific context and content of any internal agency communications related to the initiative.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; (2) About $120 million this year for drug-free prison initiatives. You will announce the availability or release of the following grants to ensure that states fully implement their comprehensive plans for prison drug testing, treatment, and sanctions:	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in this statement does not fall under either of those categories and is not related to any inter-agency or intra-agency communication. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; -- Up to $50 million for prison drug testing and intervention. Today the Justice Department will release new guidance informing states that they can use up to 10 percent of their prison construction funds (Violent Offender Incarceration/Truth-in-Sentencing grants) to drug test and treat prisoners and parolees. Last year, you called on Congress to give the states this flexibility, and he fought for it to be included in the final budget agreement.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the statement is not a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it contain privileged information. It is a statement of policy and funding guidance, which is generally not protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; -- $63 million for residential drug treatment in state prisons. The Justice Department also will announce the availability of $63 million for state prisons to provide long-term drug treatment and intensive supervision for prisoners with the most serious drug problems.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process privilege. The statement provided is a public announcement of the availability of funds, which does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; -- $6 million for new Drug-Free Prison initiatives. You will announce that the Office of National Drug Control Policy will award $6 million in grants to help 8 states (AL, AZ, CA, FL, KS, MD, NJ, NY) and the Federal Bureau of Prisons make and keep their prisons drug-free. These grants will support surveillance systems, drug-sniffing K-9 teams, advanced technologies for drug detection, and other efforts to detect and deter drug use in prisons.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The announcement of the grants could be considered part of the agency's decision-making process and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, it is also possible that the information could be released if the agency determines that the public interest in disclosure outweighs the need for confidentiality. Ultimately, the decision would depend on the specific circumstances and the agency's interpretation of the exemption.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; SEQUENCE OF EVENTS - YOU will be announced onto the stage accompanied by stage participants. - Director McCaffrey will make introductory remarks and introduce the Attorney General. - The Attorney General will make remarks and introduce the Lt. Governor. - The Lt. Governor will make remarks and introduce YOU. - YOU will make remarks and then depart.	No, this sequence of events would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This sequence of events does not involve any such communications and is therefore not subject to exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; REMARKS Provided by Speechwriting.	Yes, the remarks provided by speechwriting would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. Speechwriting is a part of the agency's internal decision-making process, and the remarks provided are likely to contain pre-decisional and deliberative information that is exempt from disclosure. Additionally, the remarks may contain attorney-client privileged information if they were prepared with the assistance of agency attorneys. Therefore, the agency may withhold the remarks under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Q The Administration says that it has increased drug testing and treatment in the federal prisons, but the Justice Department report suggests a decrease in inmate treatment since 1991. How do you explain this contradiction?	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The question posed does not involve such privileged communications, but rather seeks an explanation for a perceived contradiction between two statements made by the Administration and the Justice Department. Therefore, this question would not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; We have definitely increased the number of federal inmates that are drug tested and treated. The 1994 Crime Act mandated that, by the end of FY 1997, all federal prisoners eligible for residential drug treatment should receive such treatment. As a result, by 1998, the Federal Bureau of Prisons was conducting about 30,000 more drug tests per year and providing residential drug treatment to four times as many prisoners. The number of inmates participating in other types of drug abuse and education programs also increased during this time.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. The statement provided is a factual statement about the implementation of a federal law and the resulting increase in drug testing and treatment for federal inmates. It does not involve any deliberative process or decision-making and therefore would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; However, these increases may not have kept pace with the rapid growth in the prison population during that same period. In fact, between 1991 and 1997, the federal prison population grew by well over 50 percent (from 71,000 to about 113,000). Thus, even while more treatment slots were being made available -- and more prisoners were participating in other drug abuse and education programs -- the overall percentage in treatment may have declined.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it relate to any decision-making process. It is a factual statement about the growth of the federal prison population and the availability of treatment programs. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Finally, it should be noted that the Justice Department report includes a disclaimer saying that -- because the likelihood of receiving treatment increases as a prisoner’s release date approaches -- it may have underestimated the total number of prisoners who will ultimately receive drug treatment.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. The statement in question is a disclaimer included in a report and does not involve any inter-agency or intra-agency communication. Additionally, the statement does not appear to be pre-decisional or deliberative in nature, but rather a factual statement about the report's limitations. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Q What will the overall increase in funding be for drug testing and treatment as a result of this new initiative?	The question would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not pertain to any privileged or confidential communication within the government. It is a straightforward request for information regarding funding for a specific initiative, and therefore falls under the purview of FOIA's mandate for government transparency and accountability.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The “zero tolerance” drug supervision initiative represents a funding enhancement of $112 million for FY 2000. This includes: $100 million in new funds for states and localities to drug test and treat prisoners, parolees, and probationers; an increase of $10 million for additional drug courts (from $40 to $50 million); and an increase of $2 million for the residential drug treatment in state prisons (from $63 million to $65 million).	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The funding allocation and specific details of the drug supervision initiative may be considered internal agency communications that are part of the decision-making process and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, it ultimately depends on the specific circumstances and context of the information.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; You’ve talked about a “zero tolerance” policy for prisoners and drugs before, as well as requiring states to drug test and treat offenders. What is really new about today’s announcement?	The following statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. ; ; FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. However, the statement provided does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency. It is a question posed to an individual regarding a policy announcement. Therefore, it is unlikely that this statement would be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Today’s announcement takes us a step further in accomplishing comprehensive testing and treatment for offenders in two significant ways. First, the President’s FY 2000 budget initiative proposes over $100 million in new, direct funds for states to carry out their own plans to test and treat prisoners and parolees. And second, these funds can be used, for the first time, to begin to test and treat the over 3 million adult probationers -- two-thirdsof which have serious substance abuse problems.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency that is part of a decision-making process. It is a public announcement of a budget proposal and its potential impact on testing and treatment for offenders.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; What is the average cost of a drug test?	No, the question about the average cost of a drug test would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The question about the cost of a drug test does not fall under any of the categories of information that are exempted under FOIA exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The Federal Bureau of Prisons spends less than $9.00 per drug test for the nearly 130,000 drug tests it conducted last year. Costs can vary depending on the number of drugs tested for, procedural requirements, and the number of tests needed (lower quantities will cost more.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the statement does not fall under any of the categories protected by exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Is overall drug use increasing or decreasing? And how does it compare to the statistics contained in today’s report on prisoner drug use?	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement in question does not involve any such communication and is simply a request for information. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; According to the most recent National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, there were 13.9 million current drug users in 1997 -- or about half the number of drug users during the peak year of 1979. These nearly 14 million drug users represent about 6 percent of the American population age 12 and older, and the number has remained roughly flat since 1992.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in this statement is statistical data from a survey and does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; By comparison, current drug use by prisoners has increased since 1991 and ranges between 5 to 10 times greater than the overall population.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or contain deliberative process material. The statement provided does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it contain privileged or deliberative information. It is a statement of fact and statistics, which would not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; But isn’t youth drug use increasing?	"It is unlikely that the statement ""But isn’t youth drug use increasing?"" would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, the statement in question does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be deliberative in nature. It is simply a question that could be asked by anyone and does not reveal any internal government decision-making processes. Therefore, it is unlikely that it would be protected under FOIA exemption 5."
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Not according to the most recent study released by the Department of Health and Human Services. The 1998 Monitoring the Future Survey showed that for the second year in a row, youth drug use, in nearly every category, has either decreased or leveled off among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders. Specifically, marijuana use -- the most widely used drug by teens -- appears to have leveled off, with declines reported for the second year. Just as importantly, youth attitudes toward drugs appear to be turning around, with more young people viewing marijuana use as risky behavior.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency that is part of a decision-making process. It is a statement of facts and findings from a study conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; So, while teen drug use remains unacceptably high -- and considerably higher than its low point in 1991 -- we are encouraged by these positive trends.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement provided does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it relate to any decision-making process. It is a general statement about teen drug use trends and does not contain any privileged or confidential information. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Acknowledge:Atty. Gen. Reno, Gen. McCaffrey, Lt. Gov. Townsend. I want to thank her for pioneering a tough program of drug treatment and testing in her state. Reno Mayor Jeff Griffin, who chairs the Crime Committee at the United States Conference of Mayors. I thank the Mayor and the conference for their leadership; Reno Police Chief Jerry Hoover. Our special guests from Maryland, who have been leaders on these issues: Special Ass’t. Atty. General Francis William Mann; Del. Peter Franchot; Baltimore City Police Commisioner Thomas Fraiser; Baltimore Council Member Rochelle ""Rikki"" Spector."	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. This is simply a list of individuals who were acknowledged during a speech or event and does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of government decision-making.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Six years ago, America was at peace, but many of our communities were at war. Illegal drugs were ravaging cities on both coasts and in the American heartland in between. Crack and methamphetamine use were at near-epidemic levels. Drug dealers who controlled whole neighborhoods thought nothing of opening fire on passing police cars. Too many communities lived in terror. Too many children feared they would not live to march in their high school graduations.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The passage provided does not contain any such privileged communications, but rather describes a historical context and societal issue.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; I took office determined to give all those children back their futures and ail those communities back their peace of mind. In every successive year of my presidency, I have proposed and passed the largest anti-drug budget ever. Between 1996 and 1999 alone, we have increased funding for anti-drug efforts by more than 30% -- even as we produced the first balanced budget in a generation. And under the leadership of Gen. McCaffrey, we have put these resources to very good use: Unprecedented new tools for domestic law enforcement. Unprecedented new campaigns to convince young people that drugs kill. Unprecedented new efforts to stem the flow of drugs across our borders. Unprecedented new efforts to stop the revolving door between prison and the street, between drug use and criminal activity.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it involve any decision-making process. It is a public statement made by the President about his administration's efforts to combat drug use. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; As you've heard from Gens. Reno and McCaffrey, our strategy is working. Not only do we have the lowest crime rates in 25 years. Overall drug use is falling. Even drug-use among young people is beginning to decline.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. The statement provided does not appear to be deliberative in nature and does not involve any decision-making process. It is a statement of fact regarding the success of a strategy and the current state of crime and drug use. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; But now is not a time to rest. Now is the time to work harder than ever to build on these very encouraging trends. At this time of prosperity, we have the resources, the proven strategies, and the confidence to make this new year the best year ever for reducing drugs and crime.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement provided does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency that is part of a decision-making process. It is a general statement about the need to work harder to reduce drugs and crime.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; I believe that there is no better way to meet this ambitious goal than to expand our efforts to force prisoners to make a clean break from drugs. Today, we are releasing a new study by the Department of Justice that offers even more convincing evidence that drug use stokes all types of crime, from property crimes like burglary and auto theft, to violent crimes like assault and murder. It shows that one in six offenders landed in prison for a crime he committed just to get money for drugs...that nearly a third of prisoners were using drugs at the time they committed their crimes...and that more than 80% of prisoners have a history of drug abuse. There is no question that if we are to continue reducing the rate of crime, we cannot afford to continue releasing criminals with their dangerous drug habits intact.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing internal research conducted by the Department of Justice, which could be considered privileged information. However, it is important to note that exemption 5 only applies to information that is pre-decisional and deliberative in nature, meaning it was created before a final decision was made and is part of the agency's decision-making process. If this statement was made after a decision had already been made, it may not be protected under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; As you have heard from Gens. Reno and McCaffrey, we have already done much to expand drug-testing and treatment in federal prisons and to encourage states to do the same. But today, we will make a quantum leap forward. I am proud to announce that the balanced budget I will submit to Congress will contain a $215 million zero-tolerance drug-supervision initiative, our nation's most comprehensive effort ever to test and treat not only criminals in prison, but also those out on probation and parole. To inmates in every state we will say: If you stay on drugs, then you'll stay behind bars. And to probationers and parolees the message will be equally clear: If you want to keep your freedom, you have to keep free of drugs.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. This statement is a public announcement made by a government official and does not involve any internal deliberations or decision-making processes. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Through this initiative, we will also expand our efforts to help communities build and administer drug courts. As you have heard from Gen. Reno, drug courts are one of the most effective ways of making offenders give up both drugs and a life of crime. When I took office there were four drug courts in operation, including the one Gen. Reno launched in Miami. Today, there are more than 400. And if my budget proposal is approved by Congress, we can have more than a thousand up and running by the end of next year.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it involve any decision-making process. It is a statement made by a public official about a policy initiative and its potential impact. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Iam also proud to announce that on top of these new budget proposals,we will free another $120 million for drug-free prison initiatives this year -- funds that will help states boost testing and treatment and purge their prisons of drugs with advanced new technologies.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be part of a decision-making process. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; In these final years of the 20th century, America has made tremendous progress in our efforts to free our children and our communities from the dangerous threat of drugs and crime. Now, as we begin a new century and a new millennium, we have a remarkable opportunity to harness all the resources of our criminal justice system -- our courts, prisons, prosecutors, probation officers, and police -- to break the drug habits of our prisoners, and break the cycle of drugs and crime for all time. Let us seize it. Thank you and God bless you.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided is a public speech and does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D1//			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; I've suggested to both MD and ONDCP that they should postpone their 12/9 ""Drug-Free Prisons"" event until the first week in January when we anticipate being able to do a broader coerced abstinence event with new guidance for the use of prison funds, a DOJ report on drug testing/treatment in prisons and ONDCP's drug detection grants. The ONDCP announcement -while not huge -- links nicely with the prison grants and would allow us to show -- exactly a year after the President signed a directive on ""zero tolerance” for drugs in prisons -- that we've made progress on 2 out of the 3 issues we identified at the time: (1) up to $50 million for the 50 states to do more testing and treatment; and (2) $4 million for 8 key states to implement drug detection technologies to keep drugs out of prisons (MD, CA, AZ, AL, FL, NJ, NY and KS). (FYI: The third issue was increased penalties, at the state level, for trafficking drugs into prisons.)"	This statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement does not appear to contain any privileged legal advice or deliberative process, but rather discusses scheduling and planning for events related to drug testing and treatment in prisons. Therefore, it would likely be subject to disclosure under FOIA.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Should we also have cabinet affairs or someone else reach out to McCaffrey's folks to make the same request?	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not involve any such communication and is not related to any decision-making process. It is a simple inquiry about reaching out to someone, and therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; In his radio address to the nation, the President will announce the findings of a Justice Department study showing that in 9 of 23 cities the number of arrestees who tested positive for drug use remained the same or decreased slightly from 1996. This includes New York, Chicago and Detroit - where cocaine use is declining, marijuana is leveling off, and methamphetamine (meth) is not a major substance of abuse.	Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The information is based on a Justice Department study, which could be considered an internal communication within the agency. Additionally, the information may be considered pre-decisional, as it is being presented in advance of the President's radio address and may be subject to further discussion or analysis within the agency.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Additionally, the President will announce: (1) $27 million in grants for more than 150 drug courts that use the full power of the criminal justice system to rid crime-committing addicts of their drug habits; and (2) the availibility of $5 million in grants for local law enforcement agencies to combat methamphetamine trafficking.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement in question is a public announcement made by the President and does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Drug Use by Arrestees . Cocaine use decreasing. Cocaine use continues to decline, most dramatically in the West and Northeast -- where use had reached epidemic levels (80% and more) in the late 1980's -- and among younger arrestees. In Detroit and Washington, D.C., only 5% of young adult arrestees tested positive for cocaine, while nearly half of all older arrestees tested positive for that drug.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information about drug use by arrestees is not a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor is it privileged or confidential. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; . Marijuana use leveling off. After increasing over the past several years, marijuana use by younger arrestees is leveling off. Fifteen of the 23 sites reported drops in marijuana use by younger arrestees -- including substantial drops in Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Omaha, Phoenix, and Washington, D.C.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the statement does not fall under this category and therefore would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; . Methamphetamine use rebounds. Meth, which is almost completely absent outside of the West and Southwest, increased in San Diego, Phoenix, San Jose, Portland (OR), Omaha, Dallas and Denver. Previously, meth use had declined over the past 2 years in these cities.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement provided does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be part of a decision-making process. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; . New heroin problem in some cities. Although heroin abuse remains relatively constant and concentrated among older arrestees, this is not true in New Orleans, Philadelphia and St. Louis. Younger arrestees are more likely to test positive for heroin in these 3 cities.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; . The Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program (ADAM). ADAM is conducted by the Department of Justice’s National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and provides drug use trends as well as a critical local perspective to the national drug problem. ADAM data is obtained through drug tests and interviews with a population of arrestees. In 1997, ADAM collected data in 23 major metropolitan sites from 19,736 adult males, 7,547 adult females at 21 sites, 3,686 juvenile males in 12 sites and 647 juvenile girl detainees in 8 sites. To continue to help communities respond to local drug problems, the Administration plans to expand ADAM to a total of 35 cities this year and even more in coming years.	It is possible that ADAM data could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by the deliberative process privilege. The deliberative process privilege protects documents that are predecisional and deliberative in nature, meaning they were created before a final decision was made and contain opinions, recommendations, or advice related to that decision-making process. ; ; In this case, it is possible that ADAM data could be considered predecisional and deliberative if it is used to inform policy decisions related to drug enforcement or treatment programs. However, it is also possible that the data could be considered factual and therefore not protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether ADAM data is protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific context in which it is being requested and the agency's justification for withholding it.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; President Clinton: A National Policy on Coerced Abstinence . Expanding drug courts nationwide. Today, the Justice Department will provide $27 million in drug court funding for more than 150 jurisdictions to plan, implement, or enhance new and existing drug courts.	No, the statement made by President Clinton would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. The statement made by President Clinton is a public announcement of a national policy and a funding allocation, and therefore does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Leading the national drug court effort. Since the creation of President Clinton’s drug court initiative in the 1994 Crime Act, the number of drug courts has grown exponentially. According to the National Association of Drug Court Professionals, the number of drug courts has increased from 12 in 1994 to more than 400 today. And by the year 2000, it is estimated that there will be more than 1,000 drug courts throughout the country.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

The information provided in the statement is not a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it contain privileged or confidential information. It is a statement of fact about the growth of drug courts in the United States and does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Rigorous testing and sanctions. A recent study by Columbia University’s National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) concluded that drug courts provide more frequent drug testing, and closer supervision than other forms of community supervision. In fact, 55% of drug courts test offenders at least twice weekly, and 35% test offenders at least every week.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement provided is a factual statement from a study conducted by an external organization and does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Keeping offenders drug- and crime-free. The CASA study also found that drug use and criminal behavior were substantially reduced while offenders were under drug court supervision, as well as after leaving the program. For example, only 4% of the drug court participants in Jackson Country, MO, were rearrested -- as compared to 13% of those ina control group. And even after leaving the program, drug court participants -- even if they don’t complete the program -- recidivate at rates 4-20% lower than those in control groups.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided does not fall under this category and is not related to any privileged government communication.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Challenging Congress to promote coerced abstinence, This past year, two states -Connecticut and Maryland -- adopted statewide policies of coerced abstinence, and the President challenged Congress to follow their lead by passing his $85 million drug testing and intervention initiative. This initiative will allow states and localities to test and treat probationers, prisoners and parolees.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

The statement in question does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be part of a decision-making process. It is a statement made by the President challenging Congress to pass a specific initiative. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A strong record promoting coerced abstinence. President Clinton has consistently promoted a policy of drug testing, sanctions, and treatment for drug offenders. He has required states to drug test prisoners and parolees as a condition for receiving prison grants; called for drug testing of federal criminal defendants; expanded testing and treatment in federal prisons; and proposed allowing states to use federal prison funds for drug detection, testing and treatment.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement provided is a record of President Clinton's public policy and actions, not an internal communication between government agencies or officials. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Halting the Spread of Methamphetamine Using community policing to combat meth. Justice’s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) will make nearly $5 million available to jurisdictions with a documented meth problem. Funds can be used for meth enforcement, intervention, and prevention. The 6 participating cities are: Phoenix, AZ; Salt Lake City, UT; Oklahoma City, OK; Dallas, TX; Little Rock, AR; and Minneapolis, MN.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the statement is not a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it contain privileged or confidential information. It is a public announcement of a program and the allocation of funds, which would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; An ongoing strategy on methamphetamine. The President fought for and signed a comprehensive meth strategy that increases penalties for trafficking in meth, and toughens the penalties for trafficking in the precursor chemicals used in its production. Meth enforcement remains a top law enforcement priority, and the President’s Drug Strategy and Budget call for $24.5 million to hire 100 new DEA agents to target meth trafficking.	Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The information provided appears to be part of an ongoing strategy and policy discussion related to drug enforcement, which would likely involve internal deliberations and communications between government officials. As such, it would likely be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
D0//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The report on jail inmates released today by the Justice Department confirms the urgent need for government at all levels to pursue a policy of coerced abstinence for drug offenders. The report shows that more than half of these criminals used drugs in the month prior to their arrest. We have an obligation to install a tough system of testing, treatment and punishment for drug offenders to prevent them from returning to the streets with dangerous drug habits intact. Congress can take the lead by adopting my Administration’s proposals to promote coerced abstinence throughout the criminal justice system.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement is a public statement made by the President and is not part of any decision-making process.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Mary had an idea for an event on heroin and the fashion industry: in the wake of the President blasting them on heroin-chic ads, the industry put together a council to reform themselves, we thought we should publicize their response. You guys kind of liked the idea.	No, the given statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and are part of the decision-making process. However, the given statement does not involve any inter-agency or intra-agency communication, nor does it involve any deliberative process related to any decision-making. It is simply an idea for an event and does not fall under the scope of FOIA exemption 5.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Now there is a report coming out that will show heroin use is up. Mary sent the event idea to Rahm who liked it (dovetailing with the report) and suggested DPC put together a scheduling request.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of a report and the suggestion to put together a scheduling request could potentially be considered part of the agency's decision-making process and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances and context of the communication.
D1//			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; We're sending the memo over to Jjose/Leanne for figuring out if this is a good idea. Options include having the fashion/entertainmenj/people come to the WH to talk about reforming the images they use, a PSA campaign, etc.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of sending the memo to specific individuals for evaluation suggests that the communication is part of an internal deliberative process, which could be considered privileged. However, the specific content of the memo and the nature of the proposed actions would need to be further evaluated to determine if they fall under exemption 5.
