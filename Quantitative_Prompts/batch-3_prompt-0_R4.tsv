FOIA exemption 5 generally covers privileged communications, attorney work product, and certain deliberative process materials. Whether or not the information you are referring to falls under this exemption would depend on the specific content and circumstances surrounding it.
T0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; MEMORANDUM FORTHE CHIEF OF STAFF FROM: SUBJECT: Bruce Reed Cynthia Rice Child Support and Gambling	It is not possible to determine whether the mentioned memorandum would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 without additional context or information about the content of the memorandum. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or contain deliberative process material.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Issue Given opposition to the provision in the President's budget to intercept gambling winnings from parents who owe child support, ·should we: (1) Officially amend the proposal to make it a small scale demonstration, with voluntary     • participation on the part of gambling establishments, submitting a budget amendment with substitute pay-fors; or (2) Agree to not push the proposal.	No, this issue would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are typically protected under this exemption.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Background on the Proposal The responsible fatherhood initiative in the President's budget includes new measures to:     1) collect child support from parents who can afford to pay; 2) ensure that more child support goes directly to families; and 3) provide funds to help more ""deadbroke"" fathers who owe child support go to work. The package of child support collection initiatives includes intercepting gambling winnings from parents who owe support, which will collect about $350 million for families and raise nearly $190 million in federal revenues over five years. Gaming establishments currently must report to the IRS certain gambling winnings1; under this proposal, they would also check to see if these individuals owe child support, and if so, retain winnings for the gamblers' children2"	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications and deliberative process. The proposal may involve internal discussions and decision-making within the government, which could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, it ultimately depends on the specific circumstances and context of the information.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;  1 Under current law, tribal and nontribal gambling establishments must complete and send to the IRS form W2G, reporting the name, social security number and amount of winnings for patrons with keno winnings above $1,500, bingo and slot machine winnings above $1,200, and winnings above $600 when the winnings are at least 300 times the amount of the wager.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it pertains to a requirement under current law and is not related to any deliberative process or communication within the government.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 2 For all gambling winners exceeding the thresholds listed above, the gambling establishment would transmit the individual's name, social security number and amount of winnings via computer to a secure internet site where it would be matched against information on parents who owe at least $500 in child support. The match inquiry would report back: I) there is no match and the individual does not owe past due child support; 2) the individual owes past due child support which exceeds the amount of the individual's winnings, therefore, the entire amount of winnings should be retained; or 3) the individual owes child support but the amount does not exceed the amount of winnings; therefore, only the amount of child support owed should be retained. 2	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications and deliberative process. However, it would depend on the specific circumstances and whether the information was considered privileged or part of a deliberative process. Additionally, FOIA exemptions are subject to interpretation and can be challenged in court.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Reaction to the Proposal Opposition to. the child support gambling proposal has come from several sources. Trtbal organizations have numerous concerns, including  that_  he proposal  was  made without consultation, violates their sovereignty by requiring them to enforce federal and state laws,.and requires their gambling establishments to dedicate  staff time  and  other resources  to  collecting child support. The National Indian Gaming.Commission,' the federal agency  with  oversight  of tribal gaming, opposes the proposal. Democratic members of Congress,.in particular Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-NV), have also·c.alled for us to. abandon the proposal because of the burden it would  impose on the industry.   ·   ·	It is possible that some portions of this text could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, this would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the creation and dissemination of the text. Without more information, it is difficult to determine definitively whether exemption 5 would apply.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Child support legislation is likely to move through the Ways and Means Committee this Spring. Human Resources Subcommittee  staff are planning  a hearing in late March  and  a mark­ up in April. There is bipartisan consensus on the need to simplify the current child support         ◦ distribution rules, to ensure more child support goes directly to families, and the committee will need child support collection proposals to help offset the costs. Currently"", the committee staff have the gambling proposal, as well our other child support budget proposals, on their proposed list, which is not yet public. However, Democratic staff think that because CBO has scored the gambling provision as raising only $36 miilion (compared to our nearly $190 millionscore), that         ◦ they will drop the gambling proposal if they receive protests."	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Pay-for Options · If we submit a budget amendment officially changing our proposal in a way that.lowers the savings; OMB believes we should propose substitute ·;pay-fors. Several child support options are currently being·examined; early estimates show they likely will raise only about $50 million of the cost. The remaining costs could be made up by proposing a pay-for that HHS vigorously protested during the development of the budget, which would moderately reduce the amount.of performance-based child support funds made available to states at the same time we make other . changes that are advantageous to states. 2.	"It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of OMB and HHS suggests that this is an internal discussion within the government, and the mention of ""pay-for"" options and budget amendments suggests that this is sensitive information related to the government's budget and financial decisions. However, whether or not this information is actually protected would depend on the specific circumstances and the agency's justification for withholding it."

It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications and deliberative process. The statement suggests that the agency has considered the potential impact of denying licenses to individuals who have not paid child support, and has weighed the benefits and drawbacks of such a policy.

Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications and deliberative process privilege.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     I. Background: Under current law, states generally retain child support collected on behalf of TANF-assisted families as one of several sources of program financing. This .support is split between the State and Federal Government  as  reimbursement  for  welfare  services.  Under welfare reform, states were given the option of continuing  the  previous  $50 pass-through,  but most states have opted not to do so. However, some pass-through a portion (typically $50) and disregard this amount in calculating the family's  TANF  benefits.  A  few  (including  Wisconsin and Vermont) have federal waivers which allow them  to pass-through  all of the support collected to the family. Wisconsin disregards the support in calculating assistance -- Vermont does not.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and attorney work product privilege. However, it would depend on the specific context in which this information was being requested and whether it met the criteria for exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     II. Issues: 1) Disincentives: Non-custodial parents of TANF assisted children are discouraged from paying support because their money goes to the government and does not benefit their children directly. Custodial parents also have less incentive to cooperate with the CSE agency since payments are generally not forwarded to them. 2) Burdens: Support is distributed according to when it accrues, whether a family is or ever was on public assistance and by which method it is collected. This distribution system has proven burdensome and costly both in terms of programming and personnel. 3)Unstable Financing: CSE c.aseloads have increased 44 percent since 1991, but TANF caseloads are decreasing. As discussed, states retain TANF collections, but distribute non-TANF collections directly to the families. Thus, increasing caseloads are generating a need for more resources, but the revenue-making portion of the caseloads is in flux.

D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Here's what these reports basically say: For families that are currently on welfare the rules for distribution of child support collections are generally straightforward (distribution rules for families that are not longer on welfare are  a little more complicated). Under AFDC, the first fifty dollars of child support collected on behalf of a family was ""passed-through"" to the family currently on welfare. The remaining child support collections were split between the state and federal government (according to state medicaid match rates). Since the $50 ""pass-th.rough"" was not counted as income, it increased the amount of the welfare grant by  $50.  The idea behind this was to give mothers a financial incentive to cooperate with child support enforcement. Under TANF, the fifty dollar ""pass-through"" was repealed and states must first pay the federal government its share of the child support collections (again, according to the state medicaid match rates). The rest of the child support collected on behalf of a family currently on welfare is distributed at the discretion of the state. If the state wants to continue distributing $ 50  of the child support collected on behalf of a family to that family, it may do so (although the  $50  will come from the state's share of the child support  collection,  not  off  the top as under AFDC rules). In this case, the welfare check again increases by $50. Unfortunately, most states (29 according to the ""One Year After"" paper) have decided not to pass-through any amount of the child support coHected on behalf of a family with the resu.lt that  child support  collections  have no affect on the size of the ' welfare grant in these states (unless, of course, the amount of child support collected is greater than the welfare  grant  at  which point the welfare grant is reduced to O and the family gets the full child support payment). In the 22 states with a child support  pass through, the size of the welfare grant is affected by child support collections, equal to the amount of the pass-through  (in most of these states, it is still $50.)"

Yesterday, DOT agreed to propose appropriations language that will allow tribes to apply directly for Access to Jobs grants. They also plan to set aside $5 M within the $150 M for tribes, but they think this can be done _administratively through the application process.

No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Agreement .with State Rehab. Agency: W&M staff asked ED about the purpose of sec. 1148(c)(3){D) in the Senate bill, which states that no payment can be made to an employment network who either makes referrals to a State agency in violation of their agreement  with the agency, or has not entered into an agreement. ED staff noted that this language is intended to prevent employment networks from ""double dipping""  by referring an individual to  a State  VR agency for specific services, and then being reimbursed for the services provided,by the State VR agency. W&M staff was concerned that the bill language would essentially  reassign the  ticket  to the VR agency. ED said the language just requires the provider to reimburse the Rehab agency, not give up the ticket, but said that it would look into this issue."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific circumstances and whether any privileges apply to the communication.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Mode of Election for Reimbursement: W&M staff asked about Sec. 1148 (c)(1) in the Senate bill, which gives only State agencies the option of  operating  under  the  old or the  new  payment  system, on a case by case basis. ED justified this language by  saying that, under  this  bill, the m.ost  difficult and risky cases (e.g., the most severely disabled) will most  likely  wind  up  in  the  State  agencies rather then private providers, and that the reimbursements for  these  individuals  would  usually  be lower under the new payment system. W&M staff said that  they  were  concerned  that  private providers do not have the same option in the Senate bill.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the communication and whether it meets the criteria for exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Big Picture -- Competition: W&M staff asked ED if both they and the State rehab. agencies are generally concerned that this legislation would increase competition between State rehab. agencies .and private providers. ED noted that they support the  Kennedy-Jeffords legislation in its  current form (though they have concerns  with, for instance, the P&A language),  and that competition isn't •  a major issue with the Department because there are more than enough people for both the State rehab. agencies and private providers to serve.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. This passage does not appear to be either pre-decisional or deliberative, and it does not involve an inter-agency or intra-agency communication.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; P&A: ED brought up it's concern that the Senate bill only provides a generic reference to providing information on obtaining employment and advocacy, rather than the more specific P&A language included in last year's draft H.R.  3433.  W&M said that they'd take ED's  concern under advisement.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve predecisional or deliberative information. It is simply a discussion of concerns and potential actions.

T0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We will meet as scheduled. Date:  Wednesday, April 7 Time: 12:00PM Room: OEOB 211 Subject: Work Incentives Planners and DOL Systems Change Component	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of a government agency.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; I Background: One of the original titles of the JK Legislation concerned setting up ""Work Incentives Planners,"" on a competitive state-by-state grant basis, to inform people on SSI and SSDI about their options for obtaining employment and taking advantage of the JK War Incentives. The Senate bill propsed to fund this program out of SSA 1 for $23 million a year max over five years, starting in year 2. During our budget process, we ,developed a proposal that combined the Planners with one of the Task Force recommendations for Systems Change in DOL, for a tota of $50million a year, beginning year one (roughly $23.million going to the Planners, the rest for Systems Change). We proposed this change to the Senate during, but the bill was passed out of Finance Committee without our recommended change, sticking by the $23 million in SSA."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific nature of the communications and whether they meet the criteria for exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Reason for Meeting: Senate staff and disability groups are operating under the assumption that the bill language obligates/mandates SSA to fund the program. They are separately exploring ways to appropriate funds for the Task Force Systems Change component. But, as we have discussed in recent meetings, the language would require SSA to fund the Planners out of its discretionary Administrative account, and SSA cannot therefore guarantee it will have the resources  to  operate the program. We want to inform the Congress and the advocates about our concern so that we do not run into greater problems down the road.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication. If the communication was part of a deliberative process aimed at making a policy decision, it may be protected. If it was simply a factual statement or update, it may not be protected. Ultimately, it would be up to a court to determine whether the exemption applies in this case.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Proposed Agenda for Meeting: 1) Introductions; 2) Review history and content of our DOL combined proposal; 3) Review concerns about current Senate language; 4) Q & A.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to agency decision-making or deliberations. It is a basic agenda for a meeting and does not contain any substantive information.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Attendance at Meeting: 1) Administration Representatives from DPC/NEC, 0MB (health and income maintenance divisions), W.H. Legislative Affairs, SSA, DOL, OVP, OPL; 2) Leading disability community advocates (4-6). Administration offices not  mentioned  above, but  wishing  to  attend, may do so. Just let me know.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The attendance list for a meeting does not fall under this category.

In the meantime, interested parties please hold date/time for meeting with disability representatives. There will probably be no perfect time, so I'd like to hold this one unless it poses a major problem. Thanks.

D1			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; At today's meeting, we discussed having a briefing with core disability advocates to  discuss  our ""$23 million question."" The purpose is two-fold: 1) explain our $50 million combined proposal for Work Incentives Planners and ""BRIDGE"" (and also our strategy with Congress); 2) make clear that the current language passed out of Senate finance provides no guarantee that the planners can be implemented, because it does not appropriate money for SSA (it would have to come out of SSA's LAE, or discretionary administrative account--hope I'm explaining that accurately)."	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The discussion of strategy with Congress and the explanation of the current language passed out of Senate finance could be considered privileged information.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We discussed meeting with the groups Tuesday or Wednesday, April 6-7. I'd like to suggest two windows of time: 11 :00 AM to_2:00 PM gn Tuesday, and 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM on Wednesday.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government agency. It is simply a scheduling suggestion.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We need representatives from the following: 0MB (including Barbara Chow and Dan Mendelson, if possible), SSA, DOL (that includes PTFEAD), Leg Affairs, and OPD. We'd like to keep this meeting manageable by keeping numbers small. But if  you're not from one of  these offices and really  want to attend, let me know.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government agency.

T0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; To: See the distribution list at the bottom of this message cc: Daniel J. Chenok/OMB/EOP, Maya A. Bernstein/OMB/EOP, Lori Schack/OMB/EOP Subject: Summary of T&A Session with Ways and Means	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer without additional context. However, exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) generally covers privileged communications, such as attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and certain deliberative process materials. Whether the summary of the T&A session with Ways and Means falls under exemption 5 would depend on the specific content and context of the document.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Today SSA met with W&M staff (led by  Kim Hildred 'and  Sandy  Wise), plus  a  cast  of  thousands from the Hill, to discuss changes made since the Bunning-Kennelly bill passed  the House last  year.  We worked from a copy of the  8-K  bill that  was  marked  up  to  reflect  changes. Although  HCFA sent a representative, no one from ED or DOL was present. Here is a  summary  of  some  of  the issues discussed (Medicaid and offsets were not discussed):	It is possible that some portions of this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications and deliberative process. However, it would depend on the specific content of the discussion and whether it meets the criteria for exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Scoring. Kim and Sandy noted that while the 8-K bill produced savings over five years, the changes made to these provisions by the Senate now result in costs.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided does not appear to fall under any of the categories of privileged communications protected by exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Work Incentive Grants. W&M staff noted the specialists proposed in 8-K were no longer in the bill, and asked SSA to explain the new grants. I added that the budget did not include the JKRM grants, but rather included an alternative grant program based in DOL. Kim and Sandy requested to · see any paper/legislative language the Administration developed on these grants.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific nature of the documents and the context in which they were created.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Prisoner Provision -- Privacy Act Exemption. Sandy noted that the prisoner provision language was changed and she asked· for. the rationale. We explained that  SSA  did not  need to  be exempt  from the entire Privacy Act in order to collect and  share  the  information  under  this  provision. The substitute langu<!ge is meant to  only exempt  SSA  from the necessary  provisions.. We  also  noted that OMB-OGC and SSA-OGC continue to discuss this issue. W&M seems to be  fine  with  the change as long as the data sharing can still occur, and requested that we share any future changes with them.	It is possible that this could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the communication.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Funding. In several places the Senate changed authorization language to language that looks  more like appropriations language. House staff hypothesized this  may  have  been  to  avoid  offsetting certain provisions. However, they  also  noted  that  the  funds  should  not  be  appropriated  through this bill, and would be supject to the discretionary caps. Someone on House staff volunteered  to raise the issue with the appropriators. He felt it was unlikely the House would pass the language. ·	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications. It is discussing funding and potential legislative language changes.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Reauthorization of the Ticket. W&M is unhappy with the reauthorization language {staff referred to it as a ""five year sunset provision with a grandfather clause""). CBO noted that the change has little effect on 5 year numbers, but virtually all of the program's savings are lost over the 10 year period."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The language used by staff and the analysis by CBO could potentially fall under the deliberative process privilege, which protects pre-decisional communications that are part of the agency's decision-making process. However, whether or not this information is actually protected would depend on the specific circumstances and the agency's justification for withholding it.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; CLARIFICATION POINTS Continuing Disability Reviews. There is some  confusion in  W&M  (as  in  SSA  and EXOP)  about  how the  two  provisions  that  eliminate   work  activity  as  a  trigger  for  a  disability  review  relate  to  each other. SSA volunteered to provide a written rationale for the changes it would like to make.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications and deliberative process privilege. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances and context of the communication.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Advisory Panel. W&M staff wanted to know if the Administration opposed the panel proposed in the Senate -- twice the size of the House panel and broader scope (SSA-based panel advises HHS, DOL, ED). SSA and I stated that while we preferred to build off of an  existing  interagency  panel  focused on employment for individuals with disabilities, we would not oppose the Senate panel.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific circumstances and context of the communication. If the communication was part of a deliberative process and involved the exchange of opinions or recommendations, it may be considered privileged. Ultimately, it would be up to the agency to determine whether or not to withhold the information under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; State Agency Participation in the Ticket Program. The Senate version enables State VR agencies to select payment methods on a case by case basis and to develop contracts with other participating providers/managers. Kim Hildred wants to speak to someone from ED about these changes.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Medicare. W&M staff asked several questions to get a better understanding of the provision. Specifically, they asked about the 10 year window, whether  disability  reviews  would be  conducted after an individual stops receiving DI cash benefits (they read it as ""no""), and. costs."	As an AI language model, I do not have personal beliefs or opinions, but I can provide information. ; ; The information provided does not appear to fall under FOIA exemption 5, which pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information about Medicare and the questions asked by W&M staff do not seem to involve privileged communications or deliberative processes. However, it is important to note that FOIA exemptions can be complex and context-specific, and the determination of whether information is exempt from disclosure under FOIA is ultimately made by the agency in possession of the information.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Expedited Eligibility Provision. This was not discussed in detail, though Kathy Ruffing (CBO) did note that she scored it as a small caster instead of a small saver. SSA will provide a  written rationale for this provision.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The written rationale for the provision may contain internal agency discussions or legal advice that could be considered privileged. However, it ultimately depends on the specific content of the written rationale and whether it meets the criteria for exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; ADDITIONAL ISSUES	"As an AI language model, I do not have the necessary context to determine whether the statement ""ADDITIONAL ISSUES"" would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 generally covers privileged communications, such as attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and certain deliberative process materials. However, the specific application of exemption 5 would depend on the content and context of the statement in question."
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Milestone Payments. SSA again requested that more specific language be adopted regarding milestones only being paid after an individual starts a job. Kim and Sandy believe the language that enables the Commissioner to determine the timing and amount ofpayments is sufficient.	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer as to whether the mentioned text would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. However, exemption 5 generally covers privileged communications within or between government agencies, including inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters that would not be available to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. Whether the text in question falls under this exemption would depend on the specific context and circumstances of the communication.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Individual Work Plans. Senate language provides detailed requirements of what the plans must include and takes away the Commissioner ability to waive  the plans in  certain cases. W&M  and SSA both prefer the House language.	It is unclear whether this information would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it depends on the specific content of the individual work plans and whether they contain privileged or confidential information related to agency decision-making or deliberations.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Qualification for Employment Networks. W&M staff are concerned that the flexibility built into the Senate language may allow McDonalds or other large employers to qualify for payments. SSA does not believe the language would do this.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication. If the communication is a confidential internal discussion between W&M staff and SSA officials regarding the interpretation of the Senate language, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, if the communication is a public statement or official position taken by SSA on the matter, it may not be protected under exemption 5.
