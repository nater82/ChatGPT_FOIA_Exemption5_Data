D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; MEMORANDUM FORTHE CHIEF OF STAFF FROM: SUBJECT: Bruce Reed Cynthia Rice Child Support and Gambling; ; Background on the Proposal The responsible fatherhood initiative in the President's budget includes new measures to:     1) collect child support from parents who can afford to pay; 2) ensure that more child support goes directly to families; and 3) provide funds to help more ""deadbroke"" fathers who owe child support go to work. The package of child support collection initiatives includes intercepting gambling winnings from parents who owe support, which will collect about $350 million for families and raise nearly $190 million in federal revenues over five years. Gaming establishments currently must report to the IRS certain gambling winnings1; under this proposal, they would also check to see if these individuals owe child support, and if so, retain winnings for the gamblers' children2"	"This memorandum would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are ""predecisional"" and ""deliberative"" in nature. While this memorandum is an intra-agency memorandum, it does not appear to be predecisional or deliberative. Instead, it provides background information on a proposal related to child support collection initiatives, including intercepting gambling winnings from parents who owe support. The memorandum does not appear to contain any recommendations or opinions on the proposal, nor does it appear to be part of the decision-making process. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5."

The match inquiry would report back: I) there is no match and the individual does not owe past due child support; 2) the individual owes past due child support which exceeds the amount of the individual's winnings, therefore, the entire amount of winnings should be retained; or 3) the individual owes child support but the amount does not exceed the amount of winnings; therefore, only the amount of child support owed should be retained. 2	This memorandum would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch.

Trtbal organizations have numerous concerns, including  that_  he proposal  was  made without consultation, violates their sovereignty by requiring them to enforce federal and state laws,.and requires their gambling establishments to dedicate  staff time  and  other resources  to  collecting child support. The National Indian Gaming.Commission,' the federal agency  with  oversight  of tribal gaming, opposes the proposal. Democratic members of Congress,.in particular Rep.

Human Resources Subcommittee  staff are planning  a hearing in late March  and  a mark­ up in April. There is bipartisan consensus on the need to simplify the current child support         ◦ distribution rules, to ensure more child support goes directly to families, and the committee will need child support collection proposals to help offset the costs. Currently"", the committee staff have the gambling proposal, as well our other child support budget proposals, on their proposed list, which is not yet public. However, Democratic staff think that because CBO has scored the gambling provision as raising only $36 miilion (compared to our nearly $190 millionscore), that         ◦ they will drop the gambling proposal if they receive protests."

Several child support options are currently being·examined; early estimates show they likely will raise only about $50 million of the cost. The remaining costs could be made up by proposing a pay-for that HHS vigorously protested during the development of the budget, which would moderately reduce the amount.of performance-based child support funds made available to states at the same time we make other . changes that are advantageous to states. 2.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Background: Sen. Kohl's Pass-Through Option Bill; ;     I. Background: Under current law, states generally retain child support collected on behalf of TANF-assisted families as one of several sources of program financing. This .support is split between the State and Federal Government  as  reimbursement  for  welfare  services.  Under welfare reform, states were given the option of continuing  the  previous  $50 pass-through,  but most states have opted not to do so. However, some pass-through a portion (typically $50) and disregard this amount in calculating the family's  TANF  benefits.  A  few  (including  Wisconsin and Vermont) have federal waivers which allow them  to pass-through  all of the support collected to the family. Wisconsin disregards the support in calculating assistance -- Vermont does not.	"This information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents. FOIA exemption 5 specifically applies to materials that are ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.""

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Background: Sen. Kohl's Pass-Through Option Bill; ;     II. Issues: 1) Disincentives: Non-custodial parents of TANF assisted children are discouraged from paying support because their money goes to the government and does not benefit their children directly. Custodial parents also have less incentive to cooperate with the CSE agency since payments are generally not forwarded to them. 2) Burdens: Support is distributed according to when it accrues, whether a family is or ever was on public assistance and by which method it is collected. This distribution system has proven burdensome and costly both in terms of programming and personnel. 3)Unstable Financing: CSE c.aseloads have increased 44 percent since 1991, but TANF caseloads are decreasing. As discussed, states retain TANF collections, but distribute non-TANF collections directly to the families. Thus, increasing caseloads are generating a need for more resources, but the revenue-making portion of the caseloads is in flux.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The issues outlined in Sen.

Kohl's Pass-Through Option Bill; ; Under AFDC, families applying for assistance assigned their child support rights to the state. Child support payments made by a noncustodial parent were thus paid to the child support agency rather than the AFDC family. If the child support payment was not large enough to disqualify the family from AFDC, the first fifty dollars of the child support payment  was paid to  the AFDC family each month as a ""pass-through.''. In addition, the pass-through was disregarded in the families' benefit computation. The remaining portion of the child support payment that was not paid to the AFDC family was split between the state and federal government as reimbursement for monthly cash assistance payments. Under waivers, some states changed the pass-through amount and other states treated child support payments as unearned income, disregarding some portion of the payment for the purposes of benefit computation."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context in which the information was being requested and whether any such privileged communications existed.

Under AFDC, the first fifty dollars of child support collected on behalf of a family was ""passed-through"" to the family currently on welfare. The remaining child support collections were split between the state and federal government (according to state medicaid match rates). Since the $50 ""pass-th.rough"" was not counted as income, it increased the amount of the welfare grant by  $50.  The idea behind this was to give mothers a financial incentive to cooperate with child support enforcement. Under TANF, the fifty dollar ""pass-through"" was repealed and states must first pay the federal government its share of the child support collections (again, according to the state medicaid match rates). The rest of the child support collected on behalf of a family currently on welfare is distributed at the discretion of the state. If the state wants to continue distributing $ 50  of the child support collected on behalf of a family to that family, it may do so (although the  $50  will come from the state's share of the child support  collection,  not  off  the top as under AFDC rules). In this case, the welfare check again increases by $50. Unfortunately, most states (29 according to the ""One Year After"" paper) have decided not to pass-through any amount of the child support coHected on behalf of a family with the resu.lt that  child support  collections  have no affect on the size of the ' welfare grant in these states (unless, of course, the amount of child support collected is greater than the welfare  grant  at  which point the welfare grant is reduced to O and the family gets the full child support payment). In the 22 states with a child support  pass through, the size of the welfare grant is affected by child support collections, equal to the amount of the pass-through  (in most of these states, it is still $50.)"	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The email appears to be discussing internal policies and decision-making processes within the government regarding the distribution of child support collections for families on welfare. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the email and whether any exemptions apply.

I sent them side-by-side of current law and Cardin's bill and Charlie will call DOL.     2. they generally want to be helpful on WtW but don't want to lose broader fatherhood approach. Sounds like they fear more WtW will result in less R support.     3. media campaign is intended to rec3ch a broad group of fathers • all incomes and both those living with their kids and those not. Challenge grant approach and amount is based on ONDCP campaign. They understand TANF funds can also be used to promote formation of two parent families.     4. still don't have exact costs - waiting for scoring on child support pass-through, but envision something in the $2 8 over 5 years ballpark (w/ bulk of funds for pass-through).     5. purposefully leaving block grant uses very vague to allow states to try a variety of approaches; have not yet done runs on block grant formula but realize they may need to set a small state floor.     6. they've coordinated w/ Kohl on pass through and see the major difference between their approaches · as one of cost -- they cap amount of pass-through Feds will participate in at $75 whereas Kohl is open-ended. They still understand that their propo al to allow state share of child support pass-through to count towards TANF MOE goes beyond what's currently allowed (HHS -TA here could be helpful. Charlie is reaching out to Lauren or Mary)     7. allowing states who elect child support pass-through to use $50 (this was purposefully less than the $75 to keep costs down) for fatherhood/parenting activities without getting a waiver is seen as a way to supplement the modest block grant funding. They seemed receptive to the concern that there should be some more direct benefit or connection to famllies involved with the child support program (HHS - TA here could be helpful)   .   . ' . ' .•     8. reason for explicitly listing family formation as part of the High Performance Bonus: it's not included in current guidance and this will ensure it's included in future rule.   · They'll probably revise the bill at least once more befor Thursday.·	The text would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

The Senate bill propsed to fund this program out of SSA 1 for $23 million a year max over five years, starting in year 2. During our budget process, we ,developed a proposal that combined the Planners with one of the Task Force recommendations for Systems Change in DOL, for a tota of $50million a year, beginning year one (roughly $23.million going to the Planners, the rest for Systems Change). We proposed this change to the Senate during, but the bill was passed out of Finance Committee without our recommended change, sticking by the $23 million in SSA."

Date:  Wednesday, April 7 Time: 12:00PM Room: OEOB 211 Subject: Work Incentives Planners and DOL Systems Change Component; ; Reason for Meeting: Senate staff and disability groups are operating under the assumption that the bill language obligates/mandates SSA to fund the program. They are separately exploring ways to appropriate funds for the Task Force Systems Change component. But, as we have discussed in recent meetings, the language would require SSA to fund the Planners out of its discretionary Administrative account, and SSA cannot therefore guarantee it will have the resources  to  operate the program. We want to inform the Congress and the advocates about our concern so that we do not run into greater problems down the road.
