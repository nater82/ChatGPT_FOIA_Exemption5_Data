This will require that the Congress develop a better system than the current one before it can be. repealed. This will allow members who don't think a better system can be adopted by the Congress to vote for sunset. An alternative approach is to require the sunset proposal to include a number of""poison pills"" (such as retaining home mortgage interest deduction, charitable deduction, etc.), or possibly linking to increase in minimum wage or campaign finance reform.

It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances of the communication. If it was part of a deliberative process within the agency, it may be considered privileged.

No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • (b) Estate tax repeal.

No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement appears to be a policy analysis or opinion, which is not covered by exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • (d) Cap tax revenues as a fixed percent of GDP. This proposal may have superficial appeal, but could set the stage for runaway deficits and an increase in Federal mandates on States and local governments in lieu of Federal programs.

This proposal, which provides tax credits to parents for the cost of their children's private elementary and secondary education, could erode support for high quality public education and will disproportionately favor higher-income families, who are far more able to afford private schooling for their children (even with the tax credit). To somewhat mask the unfairness, the proposal would also cover ""supplemental educational expenses"", which are ill-defined, will thus generate administrative difficulties, and will do little to reduce the bias in favor of higher-income families."	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or deliberations. It is a statement or proposal regarding a policy issue.

Nonetheless, to protect against reconciliation becoming a vehicle for big tax cuts, we should consider opposing having any reconciliation bill at all this year.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     2. Tax bills that are already in the Senate. There are several tax bills that have already come over to the Senate from the House. This is important because, of course, a new tax bill cannot originate in the Senate. The bills that have already come over include  technical corrections, the Coverdell bill, and one or two bills that undo the line-item veto of certain tax provisions in the last tax bill. These bills could be amended in the Finance Committee or on the floor to include some or all of the President's targeted tax cuts, and then be sent back to the House for conference. Keep in mind that such a tax bill would  not have the protections ofreconciliation on the floor e.g. non-germane amendments can be added. This could be helpful in adding provisions we like, but it could be harmful if provisions we don't like are added or if the bill gets bogged down with a lot of controversial amendments.

However, it is possible that this statement could be considered privileged communication between government officials and therefore exempt from disclosure under exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Second, if there is a tobacco settlement bill, it will have some tax components -- aside from the payments required of the tobacco companies. For example, the tax treatment of such payments would have clarified in legislation.· Thus a tobacco settlement bill could include a tax section to which other tax-related  provisions could  be attached.  The tobacco settlement bill-- IF IT MOVES, AND THAT IS A BIG IF --could be an ideal vehicle for targeted tax _cuts because we are already advocating using the tobacco settlement to pay for a number of popular spending  initiatives. Thus the bill could  develop an omnibus character with something for everyone.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Elena asked that I send you a note to let you know that we spoke to ONDCP, and that they said that General Mccaffrey is committed to doing a press availability on the !OM-Medical Marijuana study tomorrow. After two  years of  pointing to the study, he feels obligated to  go on the record when it is released -- and, despite our suggestion, is not willing to pull back. I have attached McCaffrey's proposed statement and the Q&A prepared by his staff. If you still have concerns about the press availability, you or John will probably need to connect w/him directly. As you know, he doesn't feel obliged to take guidance  from us on this or any other matter he views as his responsibility.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The fact that the information was shared between individuals within the government and includes proposed statements and Q&A prepared by staff suggests that it may fall under this exemption. However, the specific circumstances and context of the communication would need to be evaluated to determine if exemption 5 applies.

However, it would depend on the specific content of the Q&A's and whether they meet the criteria for exemption 5 protection.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     1. Does this report validate the message sent by voters in California, Arizona, Alaska, Washington,. Oregon, Nevada?	No, this question does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of government agencies.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • The report says that it is impossible to  estimate the  clinical  value  of marijuana and cannabinoids based on anecdotal reports. (Page 1 .19 IOM Report) This report does not address the political process that makes marijuana  available to  medically needy individuals.    And, it doesn't address public policy questions  such as the  distribution of  marijuana. But, the sense of the report indicates that distribution  marijuana  through  places  like Cannabis Buyers clubs would be inconsistent  with sensible  scientific practices.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The statement about the distribution of marijuana through Cannabis Buyers clubs could be considered part of the agency's deliberative process, and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, the statement about the clinical value of marijuana and cannabinoids based on anecdotal reports may not be protected under this exemption, as it does not appear to be a privileged communication. Ultimately, the determination of whether this information is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances and the agency's justification for withholding it.

It is possible that this question could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the question is asking for internal deliberations or discussions within ONDCP regarding their position on medical marijuana, it could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, if the question is simply asking for a statement of ONDCP's current position on medical marijuana, it may not be protected under exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • Actually this report supports ONDCP's position, as it highlights the need for targeted research on the compounds in marijuana that may be helpful to those in medical need.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communication, attorney-client privilege, or deliberative process privilege.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • Medical advancement means rigorous testing before a new  drug is released to the public. To recognize this reality is not to shut out  the  possibility  of merit in the cannabis plant but it is to reject exaggerated, at times magical, claims for marijuana.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any privileged or confidential communication within the government. It is a general statement about medical advancement and marijuana, and does not contain any sensitive or confidential information.
D1			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     3. The very first recommendation of the IOM study is to conduct more research into the effects of cannabinoids.

What does this say about the ""Gateway Theory"" that you have held?"	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer to legal questions. However, exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The statement in question appears to be a direct quote from a study, and it is unclear whether it was produced by a government agency or not. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether it would be protected under exemption 5.
D1			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • The study actually supports the fact that most drug users begin with  nicotine, move to alcohol, and then to marijuana.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • This question goes to the crux of the problem. On one hand, we have people who want an excuse to smoke marijuana to get high, claiming that they have debilitating medical conditions. On the other hand, we have a small group of terminally ill people who believe (rightly or wrongly) that marijuana offers them some relief.

It is a statement of policy and does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • What we really need is for pharmaceutical companies to develop alternative delivery systems for the compounds in marijuana.	No, this statement does not appear to be related to any privileged communication or deliberative process of a government agency, and therefore would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications and deliberative process privilege. If the statement was part of an internal discussion or analysis within a government agency, it may be considered deliberative and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, if the statement was made in a public document or communication, it may not be protected under exemption 5.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; (202) 395-6618 (Washington, D.C.) - The White House Office of National Drug Policy (ONDCP) issued the following statement today following the release of the Institute of Medicine's report Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base:	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it is a public statement issued by a government agency. FOIA exemption 5 applies to internal government communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In January 1997, ONDCP asked the Institute of Medicine to conduct a review of the scientific evidence for assessing the potential health benefits and risks of marijuana and its constituent cannabinoids. ONDCP believed that an objective and independent evaluation of research regarding the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes was appropriate given the ongoing debate about cannabis and its health effects.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege, deliberative process privilege, and certain other privileges. However, it would depend on the specific circumstances of the communication and the agency's justification for withholding it.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The report released today by the Institute of Medicine represents the most thorough analysis to date of the relevant scientific literature. It summarizes recent advances in molecular and behavioral neuroscience, in particular newly elaborated systems of transmitters, receptors, and antagonists - all illuminating the physiological effects of cannabinoids. The Institute of Medicine has addressed all issues that ONDCP requested be examined, including: the science base and gaps in scientific knowledge regarding use of marijuana for medicinal purposes; scientific information about marijuana's mechanism of action; peer-reviewed literature on the uses of marijuana; and costs associated with various forms of the component chemical compounds in marijuana and other pharmacotherapies for special medical conditions. We thank the principal investigators, members of the advisory panel, biomedical and social scientists, patients, advocates, report reviewers, and all who supported the Institute of Medicine in developing this comprehensive report.	It is possible that some portions of this report could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege, deliberative process privilege, and certain types of work product privilege. However, without more information about the specific context and content of the report, it is difficult to determine definitively whether any exemptions would apply.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The report contains six specific recommendations that address: Continued research into the physiological effects of cannabinoids. Clinical trials of cannabinoid drugs for symptom management. Evaluation of psychological effects of cannabinoids in clinical trials. Studies of individual health risks in smoking marijuana. Clinical trials of marijuana use under limited circumstances for medical purposes. Short-term use of smoked marijuana under strict conditions for patients with debilitating symptoms. These recommendations are supported by the following observations: Scientific data indicate the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoids for pain relief, control of nausea and vomiting, and appetite stimulation. This value would be enhanced by a rapid onset of drug effect.     • l[slmrt.do'ci;;;  :========================= Page 4-11	It is possible that some portions of this report could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and certain types of inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda. However, without more information about the context and purpose of the report, it is difficult to determine definitively whether exemption 5 would apply.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The psychological effects of cannabinoids are probably important determinants of their potential therapeutic value. They can influence symptoms indirectly, which could create false impressions of the drug effect or be beneficial as a form of adjunctive therapy.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to predecisional or deliberative information, attorney-client privileged communications, or certain types of inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Numerous studies suggest that marijuana smoke is an important risk factor in the development of respiratory diseases, but the data that could conclusively establish or refute this suspected link have not been collected.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement appears to be a factual statement and not a communication between agencies or within an agency.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Because marijuana is a crude THC delivery system that also delivers harmful substances, smoked marijuana generally should not be recommended for medical use. Nonetheless, marijuana is widely used by certain patient groups, which raises both safety and efficacy issues.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; If there is any future for marijuana as medicine, it lies in its isolated components -- the cannabinoids and their synthetic derivatives. Isolated cannabinoids will provide more reliable effects than crude plant mixtures. Therefore, the purpose of clinical trials of smoked marijuana would not be to develop marijuana as a licensed drug, but such trials could be a first step towards the development of rapid-onset, nonsmoked cannabinoid delivery systems.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or deliberations.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; ONDCP appreciates the contributions made by the Institute of Medicine to the debate on the medical efficacy and safety of cannabinoids. We will carefully study the recommendations and conclusions contained in this report. We will continue to rely on the professional judgement of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, and the Surgeon General on all issues related to the medical value of marijuana and its constituent cannabinoids. We note the report's conclusion that ""the future of cannabinoid drugs lies not in smoked marijuana, but in chemically-defined drugs that act on the cannabinoid systems that are a natural component of human physiology."" We look forward to the considered responses from our nation's public health officials to the interim solutions recommended by the report. - 30 –"	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; What is the scope of the heroin problem?	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Although a relatively small percentage of America's illegal drug users use heroin, the debilitating addictive effects of the drug make it one of the major sources of drug-related health, crime, and social costs. ONDCP estimates a population of 810,000 chronic heroin users in the United States in 1995. While the number of new heroin initiates is still relatively low, it is apparent that the availability of high-purity heroin (which can be smoked or snorted as well as injected) has led to an increase in use -- probably because users see smoking and snorting as ""safer"" than shooting up."	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; What are the impacts of heroin use?	No, the question does not contain any information that would be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Heroin is a toxic substance: The danger of a fatal overdose is more immediate and likely for a heroin user than for users of other common drugs of abuse because of the route of ingestion and common miscalculations of dosage. The National Institute of Drug Abuse has declared that heroin is a powerfully addicting substance producing tolerance, physical dependence, and the clinical state of addiction (defined as compulsive, often truly uncontrollable drug craving, seeking, and use).	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided does not fall under any of these categories and is therefore not exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Heroin use is associated with crime: The need to purchase large amounts of a costly drug inevitably leads to crime. For decades some cities have estimated that over half of all property crime is attributable to heroin use. Twenty percent of all people arrested in Manhattan in 1997 tested positive for opiates. In the same year, 22 percent of all arrestees in Chicago tested positive for opiates.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials.

No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Why is methadone treatment needed?	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any privileged communication or deliberative process of the government.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Heroin addiction is difficult to overcome: The psycho-pharmacological effects of heroin are extremely strong. Heroin users are more likely to be addicted to the drug than users of other drugs. (An ONDCP study of cocaine, crack, and heroin abuse in six cities found that the percentage of heroin users who used heroin for 30 or more consecutive days over a 90 day period was four times greater than the percentage for crack and powder cocaine users).	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any privileged communication or deliberative process of a government agency. It is a factual statement based on a study conducted by the ONDCP and does not contain any confidential or sensitive information.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Kicking the heroin habit without methadone as a bridge to abstinence is difficult: the same study found that heroin users reporting 30 or more consecutive days of abstinence in a 90 day period tended to be lower than for crack or powder cocaine users.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any privileged inter-agency or intra-agency communication.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Why Methadone?	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Methadone has been used for the treatment of heroin addiction since the 1960s. It is a synthetic agonist agent for opiates. In other words, methadone operates by ""occupying"" the brain receptor sites that are affected by heroin and blocks the craving attendant to addiction. Because withdrawal from methadone is slower than from heroin, it is relatively easy to maintain an addict on methadone without abrupt side effects."	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any privileged communication or deliberative process of a government agency.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Methadone treatment is the most widely used treatment for heroin addiction today. It has been studied more than any other drug treatment modality, with uniformly positive results. Over 115,000 Americans are able to lead stable lives as a result of methadone treatment. Over 900 methadone treatment programs in America provide an invaluable service.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of a government agency.

No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any privileged communication or deliberative process of a government agency.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has conducted literally dozens of studies which show the effectiveness of methadone treatment. The Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Study (DATOS), the most recent study by NIDA, found that among participants in outpatient methadone treatment, weekly heroin use decreased 69 percent, cocaine use by 48 percent (many heroin users are polydrug users), illegal activity decreased 52 percent, and full time work increased by 24 percent.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials.

This statement does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Given methadone's effectiveness, why is this new initiative needed?	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of a government agency.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In spite of this proven track record, methadone treatment capacity has not experienced marked growth. Treatment capacity is insufficient to provide most of the 810,000 heroin addicts with methadone treatment or any other effective form of drug abuse treatment. In 1995, the Institute of Medicine identified ten states in which methadone treatment was not available at all: Arkansas, Idaho, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Vermont, and West Virginia.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Additionally, studies have shown that not all methadone treatment programs are equal; the full benefits of methadone treatment are only obtained within a comprehensive treatment environment, which screens and evaluates patients and assigns them to treatment regimes based upon the nature of each patient's addiction. However, a 1990 GAO report found that policies, goals and practices varied greatly and that not one of the programs studied evaluated the effectiveness of their treatment. The failures of the unsuccessful programs tarnished the entire idea of methadone treatment, rather than spurring efforts to improve the delivery of services. This initiative is designed to ensure uniform effectiveness through new standards for all programs.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; How will this initiative make methadone treatment more available, more effective, and better controlled?	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government agency.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • Expansion of Treatment Capacity: The President's National Drug Control Strategy calls for an expansion of drug treatment capacity across the board. Specifically the Strategy seeks to reduce the gap between need and capacity by 20 percent by 2002 and by 50 percent by 2007. For heroin addicts, this means that we must increase treatment capacity to reach all who are prepared to accept effective drug treatment and supervision.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of the government. It is a statement of policy and goals that are already publicly known.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • Development of a standardized accreditation system for methadone treatment programs with transfer of regulatory oversight for methadone from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA):	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by the deliberative process privilege. The development of a standardized accreditation system and transfer of regulatory oversight involves policy decisions and discussions that may fall under this exemption. However, the specific circumstances and content of the information would need to be evaluated to determine if it qualifies for exemption 5 protection.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Replace the current regulatory approach, which focuses exclusively on process standards, with a new system that is more reflective of on an outcome-oriented accreditation model. CSAT/SAMHSA will lead the interagency effort to evaluate the accreditation process and proposed accreditation standards beginning in 1999. Based on the results of the evaluation, feedback from treatment experts, and public comments on the NPRM, a final rule will be promulgated that will introduce modernized treatment standards and an accreditation process. In the interim, programs will remain subject to FDA oversight and monitoring. Law enforcement (anti-diversion) responsibilities will remain with DEA.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege, deliberative process privilege, and executive privilege. The language in this passage suggests that it may be part of an internal agency discussion or decision-making process, which could be considered deliberative and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, the ultimate determination of whether this information is exempt would depend on the specific circumstances and context in which it was created and shared.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     • Elimination of regulatory barriers to allow individual physician administration of methadone: As physician training in the administration of opioid agonist treatment is accomplished, we must change the ineffective regulations which hinder effective treatment and allow trained physicians flexibility in how to administer this treatment (for example, through office visits as opposed to clinical programs). New regulations expanding access to methadone will be issued when testing has validated their effectiveness.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The language in the passage suggests that the agency is discussing potential changes to regulations, which could be considered part of the agency's deliberative process. However, whether or not this information would actually be protected would depend on the specific circumstances and context in which it was created and shared.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; How will this effort be paid for?	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

Funding for this initiative will come from the treatment component of the President's counter-drug budget.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; What is the timetable for this initiative?	No, the question about the timetable for an initiative would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. A question about a timetable does not fall under this category.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; 26 September 1998 American Methadone Treatment Association meeting, release oftest accreditation standards for methadone	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. However, it would depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation and dissemination of the accreditation standards. If they were developed in consultation with government officials or were intended to be used by government agencies in some way, they may be considered privileged. On the other hand, if they were created independently by the American Methadone Treatment Association and were not intended to be used by the government, they may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this information is exempt from FOIA disclosure would be made by the agency in possession of the records.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; October 1998 Publication of notice of proposed rule making	No, the publication of a notice of proposed rule making would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; At this event, you will launch the national expansion of the historic youth anti-drug media campaign -- which is already underway in 12 pilot cities. This is the largest publicly funded anti-drug campaign, with a total proposed budget of $1 billion over five years and a dollar-for-dollar match from each media outlet airing the ads. Using the full power of the mass media to change youth attitudes toward drugs, the campaign will ensure that when teens and adults turn on the television, listen to the radio, or surf the Internet, they will get the message that drugs are dangerous, wrong, and can kill you. Children are exposed to many media messages that normalize drugs.  The campaign will utilize modem media and technology to give alternative messages that will compete with these influences.	It is possible that some portions of this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the communication.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; By changing attitudes, youth drug use can be reduced. Studies of drug use rates over the last thirty years show that when young people disapprove of drugs and consider them dangerous, youth use rates decline. Furthermore, we now know that if a child can reach the age of 21 without using drugs, he or she will probably never use them.

I'd like to say a special word of appreciation to Jim Burke, the President of the Partnership for a Drug Free America. He's not as well-known to most American children as the President or the Speaker or the Governor, but no American has done more to save the children of this country from the horror of drug abuse than Jim Burke.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;    I was interested when we just watched the ads  to  see what  the young people's reaction was to the various ads.

I say that  to  make the point that the	above statement does not appear to contain any information that would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 generally applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We know from the stories that we just heard from James and from Kim, we know from all the available scientific research, that what Governor Miller said is right -- attitudes drive actions. There are lots of other factors. There are some places where kids are subject to more temptation than others; there are some blocks where there are more drug dealers than others;  all of  us have to  deal  with  that.   But we know that the more young people fear drugs, the more they disapprove of them, the less likely they are to use them. Therefore, kicking America's drug habit requires a dramatic change in attitudes, accompanied and reenforced by a dramatic increase in personal responsibility by all Americans.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Parents have the greatest power -- that's what one of the ads showed us.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Every one of the rest of us can, and must, help parents to teach their children to turn away from drugs.

I'm pleased that across the  entertainment  industry,  a real effort is now being made to help, with the anti-drug messages on the Wonderful World of Disney, anti-drug chat groups on America Online, even training sessions about youth drug use for screenwriters and producers at Fox -- something I hope we will see for all people who prepare television programs on all networks.

We work more with countries where drugs are grown and processed to try to stop the drugs from coming into the United States in the first place.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Already, we've seen an impact in the 12 cities where the ads have run as a pilot project. Calls -- listen to this --in just those 12 cities, calls to local anti-drug coalition hotlines have increased by up to 500 percent. Calls to our national anti-drug helpline have nearly tripled. Young people here in Atlanta say that the ads make them realize the serious consequences of using drugs. In Denver, middle school students think the ads could scare kids out  of  using drugs, to quote one of them. In Washington, D.C., young people say, to quote one, the ads make them stop and think about what illegal drugs can do.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Tonight, when these ads run on every national television network, they will reach more than 40 million Americans, including millions and millions of children. That is  just the beginning. Over the next five years, we'll help to make sure that when young people turn on the television, listen to the radio, read the newspaper, or surf the Web, they get the powerful message that drugs are wrong, illegal, and can kill.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications, attorney-client privilege, or deliberative process privilege.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; I'm proud to say, as has already been said by General McCaffrey, that this national media campaign was a part of the historical bipartisan balanced budget agreement reached last year with Speaker Gingrich and the other leaders of Congress. And I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for including this in our budget agreement. It shows what we can accomplish when we put progress ahead of partisanship. I will work with the Congress to fund other important programs in our drug control strategy.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any pre-decisional or deliberative process of the government. It is a statement made by a government official regarding a budget agreement and drug control strategy.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; All of us -- parents, the media, athletes, business, government -- have an opportunity and an obligation to make a real difference in the  fight  against  drugs.

No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any inter-agency or intra-agency communication or document.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; We've heard some personal stories; I'd like to close with two -- one from my family, and one from the job the American people have so generously given me these six years. Let me begin with the job.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of a government agency. It is a personal anecdote and not related to any official government business.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; I spent a lot of time haranguing, cajoling, trying to persuade, sometimes putting brutal pressure on countries where drugs are grown or processed, or through which drugs pass, trying to get people to stop doing things that send drugs  to us.  And we've had some success. We supported remarkable efforts by the Coast Guard, for example, to cut off drugs before they get to this country. But  we can never  cut  off  the  whole  flow.  And every time I'd do this, some leader of a country where drugs are grown will say: You know, Mr. President, you're right,  we have a lot of poor farmers in our country, and I wish they'd grow something else. But America has four percent of the  world's people and you're buying almost 50 percent of the world's drugs. Nobody is making you buy those drugs. So you can say whatever you want to us.  If  you just  said tomorrow  -- everybody  in America said, we're not going to buy any more drugs, all our farmers would immediately start to grow something legal and good. And that's true. (Applause.)	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Now, that doesn't let them off the hook, it  doesn't excuse the inexcusable behavior of the Colombian drug cartels or any other groups in any part of the world. But it is true. It is true. It doesn't mean we should stop trying to kill the drugs at the border and stop the imports and break the drug gangs. But it's true. If  every  American young person tomorrow  said, no, thank  you, they  would grow something else.   The laboratories would make other chemicals that are legal and not harmful. (Applause.)	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; I'll tell you another story that's fairly well-known, but I want you to think about what it means for families. This young man was brave enough to say that his mother used drugs, and talk about what -- the pain it caused the family. My brother  nearly  died from a cocaine habit. And I've asked myself a thousand times, what kind of fool  was I that  I did not know this  was going on.   You know, I got myself  elected President, I'm supposed to know what people are thinking, what's going on in their minds. How did this happen that I didn't see this coming and didn't stop it?	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to any privileged communication or deliberative process of the government.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; And when it all happened he said -- I said, when did this start? He said,  well, in high school; I started using marijuana and drinking beer. I said, how often? He said, every day. And I thought to myself, what kind of family member was I?

However, the final determination would depend on the specific circumstances and legal interpretation.
D1			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Rec: Play up the meth report and Treasury's GTO; hold the drug testing report. Also, get with DOJ on improving the criminal justice drug testing/treatment report. It's too important an anti-drug and crime initiative to get such short shrift. Here are some initial thoughts on improving the report: • ,1 ? (1) Focus on cost-benefit of testing/treatment, along the lines of new RAND report; (2) broaden to - '-'""'-,. include state and local efforts, like crime bill-funded ""drug courts""; and (3) included new actions with reports -- Drug Testing Czar (in Dennis memo)? Directive/guidelines for states to adopt c6mprehensTve testing/treatment? Push for testing/treatment dollars in juvie bill? Release of drug court funds?

However, if the report was created solely for the purpose of informing the public or other agencies about the administration's efforts to combat methamphetamine use, it may not be protected under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Moreover, the report shows that our strategy is being aggres·sively implemented and showing results. We've worked with Congress to strengthen penalties for meth trafficking and established new controls over precursor chemicals used to manufacture meth. U.S. Attorneys -- working with coalitions of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies -- are successfully prosecuting methamphetamine, including lifetime sentences for certain convicted methamphetamine traffickers. Federal agencies are working to increase information about the dangers of meth. They're producing meth-specific education and prevention materials, hosting local conferences and training local law enforcement.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A.  Methamphetamine is a synthetic stimulant drug that creates extreme aggressiveness among chronic users. The violence-prone, irrational, and aggressive behavior associated with methamphetamine usage make it an especially volatile drug. Meth can be snorted, smoked, injected, or ingested orally. The effects of methamphetamine can last anywhere from 4 to 24 hours, while the effect of cocaine is measured in minutes. The crash that occurs with the tapering off of methamphetamine's effects is often potentially psychologically disastrous.

Seizures of clandestine laboratories and along the Southwest border also increased during this time period.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; More importantly, methamphetamine is a triple killer and extremely dangerous: First, it is a cheap, highly addictive, long-lasting stimulant that often induces violent behavior; Second, labs used to manufacture meth present a high risk of fire or explosion, endangering nearby residents; and third, the toxic wastes produced by meth labs are often dumped on the ground and in waterways, posing an environmental threat to entire communities.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A.      The Drug Use Forecasting System collects meth data for 23 cities across the country. The methamphetamine use amongst the arrestees tested in the other 14 cities was so low, it was determined to be insignificant. By insignificant, we mean less than one percent.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to privileged communications, such as those between an attorney and client or those that would reveal the agency's decision-making process. The information provided in this example does not fall under any of the categories protected by exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q.  Doesn't the drop in the numbers for methamphetamine mean that·we're just generating hysteria about methamphetamine when the problem is really disappearing?	It is possible that this question could be protected under FOIA exemption 5 if it is part of an internal government communication that involves pre-decisional deliberations or attorney-client privilege. However, if it is a public statement made by a government official, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A.      Not at all. I am very encouraged by the new, lower numbers. But we are just turning the corner. Now is not the time to  let  up.  The numbers  show  that when we work hard,  we  can have  some effect. Now,  we've got to redouble that effort and help to prevent the  spread  of  this dangerous  drug to  the eastern part of the U.S.	No, this statement does not appear to contain any information that would be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     Q. If illegal drugs are such a big problem, then why didn't your new anti-gang bill contain new drug provisions?

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;         A. Our juvenile crime bill does contain increased penalties for people who sell drugs to kids and use kids to sell drugs. But we should keep in mind that existing federal drug laws are already pretty tough. Trafficking can carry up to  a life sentence.    ·	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; But we also need to do is to make sure that local prosecutors have more resources to go after the gangs that pedal drugs to our kids.

T0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q.      Mr. President, despite the 1994 Crime Act and tough drug laws, federal statistics show enormous increases in drug use among teenagers. Don't these figures show that you have failed and that you are taking the wrong approach?	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications. It is a question asked by a journalist to the President and does not involve any government documents or communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A.      I am deeply disturbed by the current trends in teenage drug use. General McCaffrey, the Attorney General and I have spent a great deal of time on this issue. That's why I've proposed a national media campaign, leveraged with private sector resources, to reach the 68 million kids at risk in this country.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications or deliberations.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; That's also why we need more programs to stop crimes and drug use from happening in the first place. We need a place for young people to go in those hours after school when they are unsupervised. If we don't, they may just wind up on a street corner using drugs or getting involved in delinquent or criminal activity. I've asked Congress to provide funds for after-school programs and for programs for at -risk youths-- so we could keep kids off the streets and out of trouble. I was disappointed that the House didn't include these provisions in its juvenile crime bill, but I'm hopeful that we'li be successful in the Senate.

Ultimately, the determination of whether the information is exempt would depend on the specific circumstances and context of the communication.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The final proposed regulation essentially makes the New York GTO apply nation-wide and on a permanent basis. Under the proposed rule, money transmitters would be required to report currency transactions of $750 or more that involve the transmission of funds to any person outside of the United States. The rule also requires the remitters to verify the identity of the person sending the funds.	"It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.""

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A:      Our experience with the El Dorado Task Force indicates that most legitimate money transmissions are between $250 and $500, and that most of the ,. ·:  ijdrugsumm.qa3  Page 5] abuse by money launderers occurs above this level. Thus, we made the threshold $750 so as to exclude the majority of legitimate businesses from reporting requirements.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context in which the statement was made and whether it was considered a privileged communication.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q:  Money transmitters are used primarily by people who do not have bank accounts -the poor and immigrants. Isn't it then discriminatory to have a $750 threshold for transmitters and not banks?	As an AI language model, I do not have personal beliefs or opinions. However, the following statement does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to privileged communications within the government. It is a statement that raises a question about potential discrimination in a policy or regulation.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A:      We do not believe the proposed regulations are discriminatory. The $750 amount applies to wires purchased in cash that are sent anywhere outside the United States. We did not focus on any particular country or region.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A.      The central challenge we face is to reverse the surge in youth drug rates-­ this is the focus of my 1997 National Drug Control Strategy and it is the primary concern of the mayors. My targeted anti-drug advertising campaign-­ which would involve about 1 percent of the federal counterdrug budget-­ holds the promise to change our youth's relaxed attitudes toward drugs. We have 68 million kids who are vulnerable to drugs. It is imperative ·that we get our kids accurate information about drugs.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; A.      Last month, I commended the Sentencing Commission for moving forward with recommendations to Congress to reduce the di_sparity between crack and powder cocaine penalties. My Administration will give them very serious consideration.  I have asked Attorney General Reno and General Mccaffrey to review the Sentencing Commission's recommendations and report back to me by the end of June.     • l[drugsumm.qa3    Page6]	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it pertains to internal deliberations and communications within the executive branch.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; However, I continue to believe that our sentencing laws must reflect that crack cocaine is a more harmful form of cocaine.

No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Q.      Isn't the National Action Plan put forward by the Mayors essentially a  criticism of your Administration's drug policy?

It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. However, it would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding the statement. If it was made in the course of internal deliberations or discussions among government officials, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. If it was made in a public setting or to a non-governmental entity, it may not be protected. Ultimately, the determination of whether this statement is exempt from FOIA would be made by the agency in question and could be subject to review by a court.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ;     A. I don't think so. On the contrary, I think the Mayors' Action Plan is complementary to our own National Drug Strategy. Both of our plans share the same number one priority: that drug use amongst our kids must be reduced. Both of our plans call for a comprehensive drug strategy that includes enforcement, treatment, prevention and education. And both of our plans recognize the importance of responding to the country's growing methamphetamine problem -- as well as cracking down on money laundering.

Historical background does not fall under this category.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Until the early 1990s, methamphetamine was largely associated with motorcycle gangs who supplied users in various parts of the United States.   Available data show that in the last few years, methamphetamine abuse has risen significantly in the West and Southwest portions of the country.    The Drug Use Forecasting [""DUF""] statistics (released in July 1996) confirmed that methamphetamine use was highest in western and southwestern locales. According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network [""DAWN""], between 1989 and 1995, the estimated number of nationwide emergency-room drug abuse episodes involving methamphetamine     • doubled, and between 1991 and 1994, the number of methamphetamine deaths nearly tripled."	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to pre-decisional or deliberative processes of the government.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The methamphetamine problem has been spreading into the Midwest and eastward into states such as Arkansas, Georgia, and Florida.

No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Unlike the cocaine business where Mexican traffickers are forced to rely upon their Colombian counterparts as primary suppliers, the Mexican organizations need n?t depend upon outside sources to manufacture methamphetamine. Once the precursor chemicals are obtained, Mexican organizations control all links of the entire production, transportation, and distribution chains -- and therefore, unfortunately, gain virtually all of the illicit profits. The Mexican organizations that dominate wholesale methamphetamine trafficking are capable of producing unprecedented quantities of high-purity methamphetamine in large­ scale laboratories.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Methamphetamine also poses a unique public health and environmental hazard because of the nature of its manufacturing process.

D1			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; Specifically, the Act directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to increase penalties for trafficking in methamphetamine and its precursor chemicals to reflect the nature of such offenses, their relative harm to society, and the need for aggressive law enforcement action.   It also requests that the Commission consider significant penalty enhancements for laboratory operators who mishandle ignitable, corrosive, reactive, and toxic chemicals so as to pose a risk to public safety and the environment.    The Department of Justice [""DOJ""] is attempting to ensure that the Sentencing Commission's Guidelines, currently in the drafting phase, reflect the legislative intent to increase penalties substantially for methamphetamine offenses."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege or deliberative process privilege. The DOJ's efforts to ensure that the Sentencing Commission's Guidelines reflect legislative intent could be considered part of the agency's deliberative process, and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, the specific circumstances of the communication and the agency's justification for withholding the information would need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; The Act includes tighter controls on retail sales of drug products containing key precursor chemicals:  ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine.  Because methamphetamine must be synthesized from precursor chemicals, regulatory control of a select group of chemicals can impede clandestine production of the drug.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In 1996, at the request of the Attorney General, each U.S. Attorney assessed the methamphetamine problem in her/his district and together with the federal, state, and local agencies, came up with a plan to address the problem.  In some cases -- particularly, in the Midwest and California -- the U.S. Attorneys developed regional strategies.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client privilege and deliberative process privilege. However, it would depend on the specific content of the assessments and plans, and whether they contain information that is considered privileged or deliberative.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; In addition, law enforcement agencies continue to develop intelligence and information on trafficking organizations and clandestine laboratories to assist in the monitoring of shipments of methamphetamine and its precursor chemicals -- with a special emphasis on major violent methamphetamine trafficking organizations. Based upon this information, federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies are selecting and pursuing the highest-level and most dangerous targets.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by the deliberative process privilege.

However, it ultimately depends on the specific content and context of the documents in question.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?; ; . There are two primary factors which contribute to the large increase in DEA seizures of methamphetamine laboratories --     (1) the spread eastward of clandestine laboratory activity; and     (2) the enhanced attention by law enforcement around the country. The spread eastward of methamphetamine manufacturers can.be attributed, in large part,·to the growth of small entrepreneurs using the ""Nazi"" method"" to produce small batches of methamphetamine (four ounces or less).   Their source of precursor chemicals frequently is pseudoephedrine tablets purchased at local retail outlets; approximately 680 tablets of pseudoephedrine yield one ounce of finished methamphetamine. methamphetamine cases have been investigated and prosecuted by federal agencies in close coordination and cooperation with the state and local law enforcement agencies, and many others have been prosecuted by local District Attorney's Offices throughout the country."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and attorney work product privilege. The language in the passage suggests that it may contain information related to law enforcement strategies and coordination between federal and local agencies, which could fall under the deliberative process privilege.
