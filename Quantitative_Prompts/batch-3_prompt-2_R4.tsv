T0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; March 8, 2000	As an AI language model, I do not have access to the specific content of the document in question. However, exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. This exemption is intended to protect the decision-making process of government agencies by allowing them to freely exchange ideas and opinions without fear of public disclosure. ; ; Whether or not the document in question would be protected under exemption 5 would depend on its content and context. If it is an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letter that contains pre-decisional or deliberative information, it may be protected under exemption 5. However, if the document contains purely factual information or information that has already been made public, it would not be protected under this exemption. Ultimately, the determination of whether a document is exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5 would be made by the agency in possession of the document or by a court if the agency's decision is challenged.
T0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; MEMORANDUM FORTHE CHIEF OF STAFF FROM: SUBJECT: Bruce Reed Cynthia Rice Child Support and Gambling	As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer without additional context. However, exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) generally protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional, deliberative, and privileged. ; ; Based on the limited information provided, it is unclear whether the memorandum is an inter-agency or intra-agency communication, or whether it contains pre-decisional, deliberative, and privileged information. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether the memorandum would be protected under exemption 5. ; ; Additional information, such as the purpose and content of the memorandum, would be necessary to make a more informed determination.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Issue Given opposition to the provision in the President's budget to intercept gambling winnings from parents who owe child support, ·should we: (1) Officially amend the proposal to make it a small scale demonstration, with voluntary     • participation on the part of gambling establishments, submitting a budget amendment with substitute pay-fors; or (2) Agree to not push the proposal.	No, this issue would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. However, this issue does not involve any such communication. It is a policy proposal that is being discussed and debated, and there is no indication that any agency or department has made a decision on it. Therefore, this issue would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Background on the Proposal The responsible fatherhood initiative in the President's budget includes new measures to:     1) collect child support from parents who can afford to pay; 2) ensure that more child support goes directly to families; and 3) provide funds to help more ""deadbroke"" fathers who owe child support go to work. The package of child support collection initiatives includes intercepting gambling winnings from parents who owe support, which will collect about $350 million for families and raise nearly $190 million in federal revenues over five years. Gaming establishments currently must report to the IRS certain gambling winnings1; under this proposal, they would also check to see if these individuals owe child support, and if so, retain winnings for the gamblers' children2"	"The proposal described would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" The proposal described is not a memorandum or letter, but rather a description of a policy proposal. Additionally, it does not appear to contain any privileged or confidential information that would be exempt from disclosure."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;  1 Under current law, tribal and nontribal gambling establishments must complete and send to the IRS form W2G, reporting the name, social security number and amount of winnings for patrons with keno winnings above $1,500, bingo and slot machine winnings above $1,200, and winnings above $600 when the winnings are at least 300 times the amount of the wager.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information described in the statement is not a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor is it privileged or confidential. It is a requirement under current law for gambling establishments to report certain information to the IRS. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 2 For all gambling winners exceeding the thresholds listed above, the gambling establishment would transmit the individual's name, social security number and amount of winnings via computer to a secure internet site where it would be matched against information on parents who owe at least $500 in child support. The match inquiry would report back: I) there is no match and the individual does not owe past due child support; 2) the individual owes past due child support which exceeds the amount of the individual's winnings, therefore, the entire amount of winnings should be retained; or 3) the individual owes child support but the amount does not exceed the amount of winnings; therefore, only the amount of child support owed should be retained. 2	This information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The information being transmitted and matched against is likely confidential and privileged information related to child support enforcement, and therefore exempt from disclosure under this exemption.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Reaction to the Proposal Opposition to. the child support gambling proposal has come from several sources. Trtbal organizations have numerous concerns, including  that_  he proposal  was  made without consultation, violates their sovereignty by requiring them to enforce federal and state laws,.and requires their gambling establishments to dedicate  staff time  and  other resources  to  collecting child support. The National Indian Gaming.Commission,' the federal agency  with  oversight  of tribal gaming, opposes the proposal. Democratic members of Congress,.in particular Rep. Shelley Berkley (D-NV), have also·c.alled for us to. abandon the proposal because of the burden it would  impose on the industry.   ·   ·	This statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement includes opposition from various sources, including tribal organizations, a federal agency, and members of Congress. These communications may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Child support legislation is likely to move through the Ways and Means Committee this Spring. Human Resources Subcommittee  staff are planning  a hearing in late March  and  a mark­ up in April. There is bipartisan consensus on the need to simplify the current child support         ◦ distribution rules, to ensure more child support goes directly to families, and the committee will need child support collection proposals to help offset the costs. Currently"", the committee staff have the gambling proposal, as well our other child support budget proposals, on their proposed list, which is not yet public. However, Democratic staff think that because CBO has scored the gambling provision as raising only $36 miilion (compared to our nearly $190 millionscore), that         ◦ they will drop the gambling proposal if they receive protests."	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, the information provided in this passage does not appear to be deliberative in nature, but rather factual information about the legislative process and proposals being considered by the committee. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Pay-for Options · If we submit a budget amendment officially changing our proposal in a way that.lowers the savings; OMB believes we should propose substitute ·;pay-fors. Several child support options are currently being·examined; early estimates show they likely will raise only about $50 million of the cost. The remaining costs could be made up by proposing a pay-for that HHS vigorously protested during the development of the budget, which would moderately reduce the amount.of performance-based child support funds made available to states at the same time we make other . changes that are advantageous to states. 2.	The passage would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The passage appears to be discussing internal deliberations and decision-making processes related to budget proposals and potential funding sources. As such, it could be considered part of the agency's pre-decisional deliberations and therefore exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Background: The purpose of 22 USC 6503 was to enforce the provisions of certain conventions entered into with foreign governments that permit commercial travelers (foreign traveling salesmen) of Contracting Parties to operate in the United States. Enacted in 1922, this Act authorized the Department of Commerce to 1) issue licenses to manufacturers, merchants and traders domiciled in the other Contracting Party to operate as commercial travelers in the United States, and 2) issue certificates  attesting  that  a manufacturer, merchant or trader domiciled in the United States was a commercial traveler.	It is possible that some information related to the enforcement of 22 USC 6503 could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege, deliberative process privilege, and certain other privileges. ; ; For example, if the Department of Commerce sought legal advice from its attorneys regarding the interpretation or enforcement of 22 USC 6503, communications between the agency and its attorneys could be protected by attorney-client privilege. Similarly, if the agency engaged in internal deliberations about how to enforce the Act or issue licenses and certificates, those communications could be protected by deliberative process privilege.; ; However, not all information related to the Act or its enforcement would necessarily be protected by exemption 5. For example, factual information about the number of licenses or certificates issued, the names of individuals or companies who received them, or the criteria used to evaluate applications would likely not be protected by any FOIA exemption. ; ; Ultimately, whether specific information related to 22 USC 6503 is protected by exemption 5 would depend on the specific circumstances and content of the information in question.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     I. Background: Under current law, states generally retain child support collected on behalf of TANF-assisted families as one of several sources of program financing. This .support is split between the State and Federal Government  as  reimbursement  for  welfare  services.  Under welfare reform, states were given the option of continuing  the  previous  $50 pass-through,  but most states have opted not to do so. However, some pass-through a portion (typically $50) and disregard this amount in calculating the family's  TANF  benefits.  A  few  (including  Wisconsin and Vermont) have federal waivers which allow them  to pass-through  all of the support collected to the family. Wisconsin disregards the support in calculating assistance -- Vermont does not.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ;     II. Issues: 1) Disincentives: Non-custodial parents of TANF assisted children are discouraged from paying support because their money goes to the government and does not benefit their children directly. Custodial parents also have less incentive to cooperate with the CSE agency since payments are generally not forwarded to them. 2) Burdens: Support is distributed according to when it accrues, whether a family is or ever was on public assistance and by which method it is collected. This distribution system has proven burdensome and costly both in terms of programming and personnel. 3)Unstable Financing: CSE c.aseloads have increased 44 percent since 1991, but TANF caseloads are decreasing. As discussed, states retain TANF collections, but distribute non-TANF collections directly to the families. Thus, increasing caseloads are generating a need for more resources, but the revenue-making portion of the caseloads is in flux.

The Child Support Pass-through is a provision in federal law that allows states to pass through a portion of child support payments to families receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits. This provision is a matter of public record and is not likely to be considered confidential or privileged information. Therefore, it is unlikely that it would be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Under AFDC, families applying for assistance assigned their child support rights to the state. Child support payments made by a noncustodial parent were thus paid to the child support agency rather than the AFDC family. If the child support payment was not large enough to disqualify the family from AFDC, the first fifty dollars of the child support payment  was paid to  the AFDC family each month as a ""pass-through.''. In addition, the pass-through was disregarded in the families' benefit computation. The remaining portion of the child support payment that was not paid to the AFDC family was split between the state and federal government as reimbursement for monthly cash assistance payments. Under waivers, some states changed the pass-through amount and other states treated child support payments as unearned income, disregarding some portion of the payment for the purposes of benefit computation."	"This information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents.

Thirty-three states have changed the pass-through amount significantly. Of those, 29 states discontinued the child support pass-through completely and one state (Kansas) maintains the child support pass-through at a reduced level, passing through forty dollars of the child support payment to the families. Two states increased the pass-through amount (Connecticut, Nevada), .and one state (Wisconsin)  passes through the entire child support payment, allowing families to keep a larger portion of the child support payment . each month without lowering the families' cash assistance benefits.

Yes, the following would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The reason is that the information provided is a citation to a specific report from the Urban Institute, which is likely an internal communication within the agency. Additionally, the information may contain confidential or privileged information related to welfare grants and child support distributions. Therefore, it is likely that the agency would withhold this information under exemption 5 to protect the confidentiality of the communication.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Here's what these reports basically say: For families that are currently on welfare the rules for distribution of child support collections are generally straightforward (distribution rules for families that are not longer on welfare are  a little more complicated). Under AFDC, the first fifty dollars of child support collected on behalf of a family was ""passed-through"" to the family currently on welfare. The remaining child support collections were split between the state and federal government (according to state medicaid match rates). Since the $50 ""pass-th.rough"" was not counted as income, it increased the amount of the welfare grant by  $50.  The idea behind this was to give mothers a financial incentive to cooperate with child support enforcement. Under TANF, the fifty dollar ""pass-through"" was repealed and states must first pay the federal government its share of the child support collections (again, according to the state medicaid match rates). The rest of the child support collected on behalf of a family currently on welfare is distributed at the discretion of the state. If the state wants to continue distributing $ 50  of the child support collected on behalf of a family to that family, it may do so (although the  $50  will come from the state's share of the child support  collection,  not  off  the top as under AFDC rules). In this case, the welfare check again increases by $50. Unfortunately, most states (29 according to the ""One Year After"" paper) have decided not to pass-through any amount of the child support coHected on behalf of a family with the resu.lt that  child support  collections  have no affect on the size of the ' welfare grant in these states (unless, of course, the amount of child support collected is greater than the welfare  grant  at  which point the welfare grant is reduced to O and the family gets the full child support payment). In the 22 states with a child support  pass through, the size of the welfare grant is affected by child support collections, equal to the amount of the pass-through  (in most of these states, it is still $50.)"

Challenge grant approach and amount is based on ONDCP campaign. They understand TANF funds can also be used to promote formation of two parent families.     4. still don't have exact costs - waiting for scoring on child support pass-through, but envision something in the $2 8 over 5 years ballpark (w/ bulk of funds for pass-through).     5. purposefully leaving block grant uses very vague to allow states to try a variety of approaches; have not yet done runs on block grant formula but realize they may need to set a small state floor.     6. they've coordinated w/ Kohl on pass through and see the major difference between their approaches · as one of cost -- they cap amount of pass-through Feds will participate in at $75 whereas Kohl is open-ended. They still understand that their propo al to allow state share of child support pass-through to count towards TANF MOE goes beyond what's currently allowed (HHS -TA here could be helpful. Charlie is reaching out to Lauren or Mary)     7. allowing states who elect child support pass-through to use $50 (this was purposefully less than the $75 to keep costs down) for fatherhood/parenting activities without getting a waiver is seen as a way to supplement the modest block grant funding.

D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; I Background: One of the original titles of the JK Legislation concerned setting up ""Work Incentives Planners,"" on a competitive state-by-state grant basis, to inform people on SSI and SSDI about their options for obtaining employment and taking advantage of the JK War Incentives. The Senate bill propsed to fund this program out of SSA 1 for $23 million a year max over five years, starting in year 2. During our budget process, we ,developed a proposal that combined the Planners with one of the Task Force recommendations for Systems Change in DOL, for a tota of $50million a year, beginning year one (roughly $23.million going to the Planners, the rest for Systems Change). We proposed this change to the Senate during, but the bill was passed out of Finance Committee without our recommended change, sticking by the $23 million in SSA."	The passage does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This passage does not contain any privileged communications, but rather describes a proposed change to legislation and the budget process. It does not appear to contain any confidential or deliberative information that would be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Reason for Meeting: Senate staff and disability groups are operating under the assumption that the bill language obligates/mandates SSA to fund the program. They are separately exploring ways to appropriate funds for the Task Force Systems Change component. But, as we have discussed in recent meetings, the language would require SSA to fund the Planners out of its discretionary Administrative account, and SSA cannot therefore guarantee it will have the resources  to  operate the program. We want to inform the Congress and the advocates about our concern so that we do not run into greater problems down the road.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The reason for the meeting appears to involve internal agency discussions about the interpretation and implementation of legislation, as well as potential funding issues. These types of deliberative communications are typically protected under exemption 5 in order to encourage frank and open discussions within agencies.

Yes, the proposed agenda for the meeting would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The agenda appears to be a pre-decisional document that is part of the agency's deliberative process, and its disclosure could harm the agency's ability to make informed decisions. Additionally, the agenda does not contain any information that would fall under other FOIA exemptions, such as personal privacy or national security.

It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, more information would be needed to make a definitive determination. If the meeting involved discussions of sensitive policy or legal matters, or if the attendance list included attorneys or other officials who would be covered by attorney-client privilege, then exemption 5 could apply. On the other hand, if the meeting was simply a routine gathering of government officials and advocates, with no privileged communications taking place, then exemption 5 would not apply.

This is simply a list of dates and times, which does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5 (inter-agency or intra-agency communications, deliberative process privilege, attorney work product, etc.).
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Once we get a time. that works in_ternally, I'll take care of notifying the groups and setting up room arrangements, clearance, etc. Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, more context is needed to determine whether this statement meets the criteria for exemption 5. If the statement is part of a deliberative process, such as discussing internal scheduling and logistics for a meeting, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, if the statement is simply administrative in nature and does not involve any policy or decision-making, it may not be protected under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Thanks everyone for your commitment to this bill. It would be a tremendous victory to get this signed by the President this year. Keep up the good work.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. This statement does not involve any agency communication or decision-making process, and therefore would not be protected under exemption 5.

Brain/WHO/EOP	It is not possible to determine whether the message would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 without additional information about the content of the message. Exemption 5 protects certain privileged communications, such as attorney-client communications and deliberative process materials, but the applicability of the exemption depends on the specific content of the communication.
T0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Record Type:    Record	The given information is insufficient to determine whether it would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are deliberative in nature and contain opinions, recommendations, or advice that are part of the decision-making process. Without knowing the content of the record, it is impossible to determine whether it falls under this exemption.
T0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; To: See the distribution list at the bottom of this message cc: Daniel J. Chenok/OMB/EOP, Maya A. Bernstein/OMB/EOP, Lori Schack/OMB/EOP Subject: Summary of T&A Session with Ways and Means	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The email appears to contain internal government communications regarding a meeting with the Ways and Means committee, which could be considered privileged information. Additionally, the email is addressed to a specific distribution list and includes individuals from the Office of Management and Budget, which suggests that it may contain sensitive or confidential information related to government operations.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Today SSA met with W&M staff (led by  Kim Hildred 'and  Sandy  Wise), plus  a  cast  of  thousands from the Hill, to discuss changes made since the Bunning-Kennelly bill passed  the House last  year.  We worked from a copy of the  8-K  bill that  was  marked  up  to  reflect  changes. Although  HCFA sent a representative, no one from ED or DOL was present. Here is a  summary  of  some  of  the issues discussed (Medicaid and offsets were not discussed):	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of a meeting between the SSA and W&M staff, as well as the presence of a representative from HCFA, suggests that this may be an internal communication between government agencies. However, without more context it is difficult to determine whether any specific privileges would apply to this information.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Scoring. Kim and Sandy noted that while the 8-K bill produced savings over five years, the changes made to these provisions by the Senate now result in costs.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. The statement provided does not appear to be a communication between government agencies or officials, nor does it appear to be pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. It is simply a statement of fact regarding the financial impact of a bill. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Work Incentive Grants. W&M staff noted the specialists proposed in 8-K were no longer in the bill, and asked SSA to explain the new grants. I added that the budget did not include the JKRM grants, but rather included an alternative grant program based in DOL. Kim and Sandy requested to · see any paper/legislative language the Administration developed on these grants.	It is possible that the information regarding the Work Incentive Grants could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. If the paper/legislative language developed by the Administration regarding these grants contains confidential legal advice or deliberative process information, it may be exempt from disclosure under this exemption. However, if the information is purely factual and does not involve any privileged communications, it would not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether the information is exempt would depend on the specific content of the paper/legislative language in question.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Prisoner Provision -- Privacy Act Exemption. Sandy noted that the prisoner provision language was changed and she asked· for. the rationale. We explained that  SSA  did not  need to  be exempt  from the entire Privacy Act in order to collect and  share  the  information  under  this  provision. The substitute langu<!ge is meant to  only exempt  SSA  from the necessary  provisions.. We  also  noted that OMB-OGC and SSA-OGC continue to discuss this issue. W&M seems to be  fine  with  the change as long as the data sharing can still occur, and requested that we share any future changes with them.	Yes, this would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, specifically the deliberative process privilege. The language in the passage suggests that there is an ongoing discussion between OMB-OGC and SSA-OGC regarding the prisoner provision and the exemption from the necessary provisions of the Privacy Act. This indicates that the agency is still in the process of making a decision and that the information in this passage is part of that internal deliberation. Therefore, it would be protected from disclosure under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Funding. In several places the Senate changed authorization language to language that looks  more like appropriations language. House staff hypothesized this  may  have  been  to  avoid  offsetting certain provisions. However, they  also  noted  that  the  funds  should  not  be  appropriated  through this bill, and would be supject to the discretionary caps. Someone on House staff volunteered  to raise the issue with the appropriators. He felt it was unlikely the House would pass the language. ·	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, this passage does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it contain any deliberative information that would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. It is simply a statement about potential funding issues and a staff member's opinion on the likelihood of certain language being passed.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Reauthorization of the Ticket. W&M is unhappy with the reauthorization language {staff referred to it as a ""five year sunset provision with a grandfather clause""). CBO noted that the change has little effect on 5 year numbers, but virtually all of the program's savings are lost over the 10 year period."	The passage provided does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This passage appears to be discussing the opinions and concerns of individuals within a single agency (W&M and CBO) regarding a specific provision in a bill. It does not appear to involve any privileged communications between agencies or within an agency that would be exempt from FOIA disclosure.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; CLARIFICATION POINTS Continuing Disability Reviews. There is some  confusion in  W&M  (as  in  SSA  and EXOP)  about  how the  two  provisions  that  eliminate   work  activity  as  a  trigger  for  a  disability  review  relate  to  each other. SSA volunteered to provide a written rationale for the changes it would like to make.	Yes, the provided information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The information pertains to internal discussions and decision-making processes within the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Executive Office of the President (EXOP) regarding disability reviews. The information is likely considered privileged because it involves the agency's decision-making process and could potentially reveal internal deliberations or recommendations.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Advisory Panel. W&M staff wanted to know if the Administration opposed the panel proposed in the Senate -- twice the size of the House panel and broader scope (SSA-based panel advises HHS, DOL, ED). SSA and I stated that while we preferred to build off of an  existing  interagency  panel  focused on employment for individuals with disabilities, we would not oppose the Senate panel.	Yes, the statement would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be an internal discussion between W&M staff, SSA, and possibly other agencies, regarding their position on a proposed advisory panel. As such, it likely falls under the category of privileged inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; State Agency Participation in the Ticket Program. The Senate version enables State VR agencies to select payment methods on a case by case basis and to develop contracts with other participating providers/managers. Kim Hildred wants to speak to someone from ED about these changes.	"It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of ""contracts"" and ""payment methods"" suggests that this may involve internal deliberations or negotiations between agencies, which could be considered privileged. However, without more context it is difficult to say for certain whether exemption 5 would apply in this case."
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Medicare. W&M staff asked several questions to get a better understanding of the provision. Specifically, they asked about the 10 year window, whether  disability  reviews  would be  conducted after an individual stops receiving DI cash benefits (they read it as ""no""), and. costs."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, more information is needed to make a definitive determination. If the questions were asked and answered in the context of internal agency deliberations or legal advice, they may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. On the other hand, if the information is simply factual and not related to any privileged communication, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Expedited Eligibility Provision. This was not discussed in detail, though Kathy Ruffing (CBO) did note that she scored it as a small caster instead of a small saver. SSA will provide a  written rationale for this provision.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The written rationale for the Expedited Eligibility Provision could potentially contain internal deliberations or legal advice that would be considered privileged. However, it ultimately depends on the specific content of the written rationale and whether it meets the criteria for exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; ADDITIONAL ISSUES	"It is not possible to determine whether ""ADDITIONAL ISSUES"" would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 without additional context. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. Without knowing the nature of the ""ADDITIONAL ISSUES"" and the context in which they are being discussed, it is impossible to determine whether they would fall under this exemption."
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Milestone Payments. SSA again requested that more specific language be adopted regarding milestones only being paid after an individual starts a job. Kim and Sandy believe the language that enables the Commissioner to determine the timing and amount ofpayments is sufficient.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. The statement about milestone payments does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be deliberative in nature. It is a statement of opinion or belief about the language in a document, which does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Individual Work Plans. Senate language provides detailed requirements of what the plans must include and takes away the Commissioner ability to waive  the plans in  certain cases. W&M  and SSA both prefer the House language.	It is unclear whether the Individual Work Plans would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 based on the given information. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are privileged and would not be available to a party in litigation with the agency. The given information does not indicate whether the Individual Work Plans are inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters, nor does it indicate whether they contain privileged information. Therefore, more information is needed to determine whether the Individual Work Plans would be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Qualification for Employment Networks. W&M staff are concerned that the flexibility built into the Senate language may allow McDonalds or other large employers to qualify for payments. SSA does not believe the language would do this.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The discussion between W&M staff and SSA regarding the interpretation of the Senate language appears to be an internal communication that is part of the agency's decision-making process. As such, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under FOIA.

Farkas/OMB/EOP Anne E. Tumlinson/OMB/EOP	It is not possible to determine whether the message would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 without knowing the content of the message. FOIA exemption 5 protects certain privileged communications, such as attorney-client communications and deliberative process communications, from disclosure. The content of the message would need to be evaluated to determine if it falls under one of these categories.
