However, more information would be needed to make a definitive determination. ; ; If the record contains confidential advice or recommendations from Mickey Ibarra to Elena Kagan, Bruce N. Reed, Lynn G. Cutler, Sky Gallegos, or Michael Cohen, it could be considered privileged and therefore exempt from disclosure under exemption 5. ; ; Case law that supports this interpretation includes NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1978), which established that the deliberative process privilege protects communications that are part of the decision-making process within an agency. Additionally, United States v. Nixon (1974) held that presidential communications can be privileged if they are confidential and relate to the president's decision-making process. ; ; However, if the record does not contain privileged advice or recommendations, it may not be protected under exemption 5. For example, if it simply contains logistical information about a White House conference, it would likely not be considered privileged and would therefore be subject to disclosure under FOIA.

Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; TEXT: I understand from Mike that he prepared a draft proposal for a WH Conference on education and perhaps some other meetings with specific constituencies to include mayors for you to review recently. When do you suppose it will be ready for circulation for comment by IGA and others?    I am hopeful that we may be in a position to announce at least the mayor segment when the President meets with the USCM winter meeting attendees for breakfast in the WH on January 30. Thanks.	"The text would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. The text appears to be a communication between two government officials discussing a draft proposal for a White House conference and potential meetings with specific constituencies. This type of communication would likely fall under the deliberative process privilege, which protects communications that are part of the decision-making process within the government. ; ; In the case of NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., the Supreme Court held that the deliberative process privilege protects ""documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated."" The text in question appears to be just such a communication, discussing the status of a draft proposal and potential timing for its release. ; ; Therefore, it is likely that the text would be protected under FOIA exemption 5."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Presidential Directive on Coerced Abstinence in the Criminal Justice System January 12, 1998	The Presidential Directive on Coerced Abstinence in the Criminal Justice System would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. This is because the directive is likely to contain internal deliberations and communications between the President and his advisors, which are considered privileged and confidential.; ; One case that supports this conclusion is Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2004), in which the court held that a memorandum from the Office of Legal Counsel to the Attorney General was protected under exemption 5 because it contained legal advice and analysis that was part of the agency's decision-making process. Similarly, the Presidential Directive on Coerced Abstinence in the Criminal Justice System is likely to contain advice and analysis from the President's advisors, which would be protected under exemption 5.; ; In addition, the directive may also be protected under other FOIA exemptions, such as exemption 1 (national security) or exemption 3 (statutory exemptions). However, without more information about the content of the directive, it is difficult to determine whether these exemptions would apply.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Announcement     • Today, the President directed the Attorney General to take the necessary steps to: (1) require states to determine the level of drug use in their prisons and report annually on their progress;  (2) grant states the flexibility to use their federal prison funds for drug detection, offender testing and drug treatment; and (3) work """"1th states to enact stiffer penalties for drug trafficking into and within correctional facilities.  The President also announced that his FY 1999 budget will include nearly $200 million for a series of initiatives to promote coerced abstinence and treatment in the criminal justice system."	The announcement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The announcement is a public statement made by the President and does not involve any internal agency communication. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under exemption 5. There is no case law needed to support this conclusion as it is a straightforward application of the exemption.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Towards a National Policy of Coerced Abstinence     • Last week, Columbia University's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) released a study confirming the need for coerced abstinence and treatment in the criminal justice system. CASA's study found that 1.4 million offenders -- or 80% of the I. 7 million criminals in prison and jails -- were either high on drugs or alcohol when arrested, stole property to buy drugs, or have a history of drug and alcohol abuse. Many other studies also confirm that the majority of individuals in the criminal justice system have similar drug histories.	The above statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The statement above is not an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letter, but rather a study released by Columbia University's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse. Therefore, FOIA exemption 5 would not apply. ; ; Additionally, the statement above does not contain any information that would be exempt from disclosure under any other FOIA exemption. The information provided is a summary of a study and does not contain any confidential or privileged information. Therefore, the statement would be subject to disclosure under FOIA. ; ; There is no case law cited to support this conclusion as it is a straightforward application of the FOIA exemptions.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ;     • Testing to Measure Progress.  Under current law and federal guidelines, states are required to submit drug testing and intervention plans for their federal prison grant funding. The President's directive calls on the Attorney General to amend the guidelines to require states to also include a baseline report of their prison drug  abuse problem, and to report every year thereafter to chart the progress they are making to reduce drug use and availability. The directive also encourages states to expand their efforts to include other offenders involved in the criminal justice system	"The information described in the scenario would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications and deliberative process. The directive from the President to the Attorney General to amend guidelines and require states to submit baseline reports and annual progress reports involves internal agency decision-making and policy development, which would be considered part of the deliberative process. ; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 protects ""documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated."" The baseline and progress reports required by the directive would likely reflect advisory opinions and recommendations, as well as the agency's deliberations on how to address the issue of drug abuse in prisons. ; ; Additionally, the fact that the directive encourages states to expand their efforts to include other offenders involved in the criminal justice system suggests that the agency is still in the process of developing its policy and approach to addressing drug abuse in the criminal justice system. As such, the information would likely be protected under exemption 5."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ;     • Helping States Get the Job Done. Today's directive asks the Attorney General to draft and transmit to the Congress legislation that will grant states the flexibility to use their federal prison construction and substance abuse treatment funds to provide the full range of drug testing, sanctions and treatment for offenders under criminal justice supervision. With this added flexibility, states could tap into the nearly $8 billion in prison funds authorized by the 1994 Crime Law (about $2 billion of which already have been appropriated to date).	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. The statement provided is a directive from the President to the Attorney General to draft and transmit legislation to Congress. It is not an inter-agency or intra-agency communication, nor is it pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. There is no need to cite any case law to support this conclusion.
D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ;     • Keeping Drugs Out of Prisons. Finally, the President's directive calls on the Attorney General to work with the states to enhance their penalties for drug trafficking into and within correctional facilities. The 1994 Omnibus Crime Bill contains tough penalties for similar crimes. The President believes we must have ""zero tolerance"" for drug use and trafficking within our nation's prison system. Automated Records Management System Hex-Dump Conversion"	The statement about enhancing penalties for drug trafficking in prisons would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. The statement about enhancing penalties for drug trafficking in prisons is a policy statement and not a communication between agencies or within an agency. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.; ; The mention of an Automated Records Management System Hex-Dump Conversion is not enough information to determine if it would be protected under exemption 5. It would depend on the specific context and content of the records being referred to. If the records are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature, they may be protected under exemption 5. However, if they are purely factual or already finalized decisions, they would not be protected. ; ; There is no specific case law cited as the scenario provided is too general to reference a specific case.

Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The Record of Accomplishment does not appear to be an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letter, but rather a public record of the President's policy and actions related to drug testing, sanctions, and treatment for offenders. As such, it would not fall under the scope of exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law cited in the prompt to support this conclusion.

The  President  fought for and signed the legislation  requiring states to drug test prisoners  and  parolees as  a condition  for  receiving prison grants.        States must now submit comprehensive drug testing and intervention plans for prisoners and parolees by March 1998 and implement  them  by September 1998.   Today's actions directly build on this effort	The statement would likely not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not appear to contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of government decision-making. Rather, it appears to be a factual statement about a legislative and policy initiative undertaken by the President. There is no case law cited as this is a straightforward application of the exemption.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Doubled the Number of Federal Arrestees Tested. President Clinton directed the Attorney General to create a program to drug test federal criminal defendants. Operation Drug TEST (Testing, Effective Sanctions and Treatment) was established and funded a pilot program to immediately test defendants upon their arrest. In FY 1997, data from 24 judicial districts indicated that 56% of defendants (9,308) were tested -- a dramatic increase over the 28% (4,929) of defendants tested in the previous year. There was also a 190% increase in drug treatment for defendants over the same period.	"The information provided would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.""

Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.; ; Case law: In National Labor Relations Board v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 only applies to documents that are ""predecisional"" and ""deliberative"" in nature. The information provided does not appear to meet these criteria and therefore would not be protected under exemption 5."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Expanded Testing and  Treatment  in  Federal  Prisons. Through  his  budgets and the 1994 Crime Act, the President has promoted coerced abstinence in the federal prison system.    In 1997 federal prisoners were subjected to nearly 130,000 drug tests.  Additionally, the number of inmates required to receive treatment increased by 3-fold (from 5,450 in FY 1993 to 17,943 in FY 1997).	It is possible that the information regarding the number of drug tests and inmates receiving treatment in federal prisons could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This exemption is often used to protect internal deliberations and communications that are part of the decision-making process.; ; However, whether or not this information is protected would depend on the specific circumstances surrounding its creation and dissemination. If the information was part of internal deliberations or communications between agency officials, it may be protected. On the other hand, if the information was publicly available or disseminated widely, it may not be protected.; ; There does not appear to be any specific case law that directly addresses whether this type of information would be protected under exemption 5. However, there have been cases where similar types of information have been found to be protected under this exemption. For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., the Supreme Court held that internal agency memoranda discussing legal strategy were protected under exemption 5 because they were part of the agency's decision-making process.; ; Ultimately, whether or not this information is protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case.

As part of the 1994 Crime Act, the President fought to launch a $1 billion initiative to spread Drug Courts across the country. Drug Courts use drug testing, sanctions and -- when necessary -­ treatment  to cut  crime and addiction.    Drug Courts have increased from a mere handful in 1993 to more than 200 that are operational today.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement provided does not involve any inter-agency or intra-agency communication, nor does it involve any decision-making process.

The President's FY 1999 Budget will continue the Administration's policy of drug testing, sanctions and treatment.  In particular, the budget includes $192 million for the following programs: -- $85 million for a new Drug Testing Initiative -- $30 million to add more Drug Courts -- $4.7 million for Operation Drug Test -- $5 million for demonstration to combat teenage drug use -- $72 million for treatment in state prisons	"The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be a policy decision and budget proposal made by the Administration, which would likely be considered pre-decisional and deliberative.

This exemption applies to documents that are both predecisional and deliberative in nature, meaning they were created before a final decision was made and contain opinions, recommendations, or advice related to that decision-making process.; ; In this case, the document appears to be a set of questions and answers related to a policy initiative, which would likely be considered predecisional. Additionally, the document likely contains deliberative information, such as opinions or recommendations about how to implement the policy. As such, it would likely be protected under exemption 5.; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 applies to documents that are both predecisional and deliberative. Another relevant case is Public Citizen v. Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, 970 F.2d 916 (D.C. Cir. 1992), in which the D.C.

The question does not appear to be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. However, the question does not involve any such communication or material. It is a simple inquiry about a public announcement made by the President, which is not likely to be exempt from disclosure under FOIA. There is no case law that supports the application of exemption 5 to such a question.

However, without additional context or information about the content of the directive, it is difficult to make a definitive determination. ; ; If the directive contains legal advice or attorney-client communications, it may be protected under exemption 5. For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1978), the Supreme Court held that attorney-client communications between an agency and its counsel were protected under exemption 5. ; ; However, if the directive contains purely factual information or policy decisions, it would not be protected under exemption 5. In FTC v. Grolier Inc. (1984), the D.C. Circuit held that factual information was not protected under exemption 5, even if it was contained within a privileged document. ; ; Ultimately, the determination of whether the statement is protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific content of the directive and the context in which it was created.

This exemption is often used to protect internal deliberations and communications within the government.; ; However, it is important to note that exemption 5 only applies if the information in question is both predecisional and deliberative. In other words, it must be part of the agency's decision-making process and not simply a statement of fact or a final decision. Additionally, even if the information is predecisional and deliberative, it may still be subject to disclosure if the public interest in disclosure outweighs the government's interest in keeping it confidential.; ; In the case of the President's directive, it is possible that the requirement for states to report on their progress in reducing drug use in prisons could be considered part of the decision-making process for allocating federal prison grant funding. However, it is also possible that this information could be considered factual rather than deliberative, since it simply requires states to report on the current state of drug use in their prisons and their efforts to address it.; ; Without more information about the specific content and context of the directive, it is difficult to say definitively whether it would be protected under exemption 5. However, it is worth noting that courts have generally interpreted exemption 5 narrowly and have emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability in government decision-making. For example, in the case of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. U.S. Department of Justice, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the government could not use exemption 5 to withhold records related to the firing of U.S. Attorneys, since the records were not predecisional or deliberative and the public interest in disclosure outweighed any government interest in confidentiality."

"The statement ""How is this different from previous actions taken by this Administration to address this issue? Is this anything new?"" would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. However, the statement in question does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it involve any pre-decisional or deliberative process. It is simply a question seeking information about the actions taken by the Administration. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this particular statement. However, courts have consistently held that FOIA exemption 5 only applies to documents that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature, and that the exemption does not apply to purely factual information or statements that do not involve any agency decision-making process. For example, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 866 (D.C.

Under the President's initiative, states must submit comprehensive plans of drug testing and intervention for prisoners and parolees by March 1, 1998 and implement them by September 1, 1998.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement provided is a public statement made by the President and does not fall under the scope of exemption 5. There is no case law needed to support this conclusion as it is a straightforward application of the exemption.

The directive also makes more resources available to states to help them get the job done	The statement would likely not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This statement appears to be a public announcement or press release about a government initiative, rather than an internal communication. Additionally, it does not appear to contain any privileged or confidential information that would warrant exemption 5 protection. There is no case law cited as this is a straightforward application of the exemption.

"The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement provided does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be part of a decision-making process. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this statement, but courts have consistently held that exemption 5 only applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 only applies to documents that are ""predecisional"" and ""deliberative."" The statement provided does not appear to meet these criteria and therefore would not be protected under exemption 5."

Is the federal government tracking the problem of drug use in its own prisons? What are you doing about the drug problem in federal prisons?	The question would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The question does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency that is part of a decision-making process. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. There is no case law that specifically addresses this question, as it is not a request for records, but rather a question posed to a government official.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; A       Under the leadership of Attorney General Reno, the federal Bureau of Prisons is carrying out model programs in drug testing, drug treatment, and drug detection.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by the deliberative process privilege. This privilege protects documents that are predecisional and deliberative in nature, meaning they were created before a final decision was made and contain opinions, recommendations, or advice related to that decision-making process.; ; In this case, if the information about the Bureau of Prisons' drug programs was contained in internal communications or documents that were part of the agency's decision-making process, it could potentially be protected under exemption 5. However, if the information was already publicly available or was not part of any deliberative process, it would not be protected.; ; There is some case law that supports the application of exemption 5 to similar types of information. For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975), the Supreme Court held that documents containing legal advice and recommendations from agency attorneys were protected by the deliberative process privilege. Similarly, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. DOE (1981), the Court held that documents containing recommendations and opinions related to agency decision-making were protected under exemption 5.; ; Overall, whether or not the information about the Bureau of Prisons' drug programs would be protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific circumstances of how it was created and used within the agency.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Drug Testing.   In 1997, federal inmates were subject to 127,460 drug tests. Two percent of tests were positive, as compared to the 9 percent average for state correctional systems. Prisoners testing positive for drugs arc appropriately punished and follow up tests are scheduled regularly to ensure they stay clean. Drug testing of correctional officers, and other selected employees is also an established policy in the Federal Bureau of Prisons.	The information regarding drug testing of federal inmates and correctional officers would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The information provided does not fall under this category as it does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency. Additionally, the information does not fall under any other FOIA exemption. Therefore, it should be available for public disclosure.; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this issue. However, in the case of Nat'l Archives & Records Admin. v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157 (2004), the Supreme Court held that FOIA exemptions must be narrowly construed, and any doubts must be resolved in favor of disclosure. In this case, the information regarding drug testing does not meet the criteria for exemption 5, and therefore, should be disclosed to the public.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Drug Treatment. In compliance  with  the 1994 Crime  Law, drug  treatment  is  provided to 100 percent of  eligible inmates prior to their  release from Bureau custody.    In fY 97, nearly 31,000 inmates participated in Bureau treatment  programs.  The number of institutions offering residential treatment has grown from 32 to 42 since FY 1994.	No, the statement about drug treatment would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement about drug treatment does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it involve any decision-making process. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.; ; There is no case law needed to support this conclusion as it is a straightforward application of the exemption.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Drug Detection. Innovative drug detection technology is being piloted at Bureau institutions.   The Office of National Drug Control Policy is working with the Bureau to provide the states with information on Lhe best ways to keep drugs out of prisons.	"The information regarding the innovative drug detection technology and the collaboration between the Bureau and the Office of National Drug Control Policy would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This exemption includes materials that are ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" (5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5)).; ; The reasoning behind this exemption is that it is important for agencies to be able to communicate freely and candidly with each other in order to effectively carry out their duties. If these communications were subject to public disclosure, it could inhibit the ability of agencies to work together and share information.; ; In this case, the information about the drug detection technology and the collaboration with the Office of National Drug Control Policy would likely be considered intra-agency memorandums or letters, as they involve communication between different agencies within the federal government. Additionally, the information would likely be considered privileged because it involves sensitive law enforcement and national security matters.; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 covers ""those documents, and only those documents, normally privileged in the civil discovery context."" The Court also noted that the exemption is intended to protect ""the deliberative process of the government"" and to ensure that agencies can ""give candid advice and opinions."" ; ; Therefore, it is likely that the information about the drug detection technology and collaboration with the Office of National Drug Control Policy would be protected under FOIA exemption 5."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Q.  Is this new reporting requirement for states on their prison drug problem tantamount to an unfunded mandate on states?	"The question would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications. FOIA exemption 5 protects from disclosure ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" (5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5)). The question does not involve any such memorandums or letters, but rather pertains to a potential policy issue. Therefore, FOIA exemption 5 would not apply."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; A.      No. By  law, states  must  develop  and implement  plans  for drug testing  and  intervention as a condition of receiving  federal  prison construction  grants.  Today's action  means  that as part of those plans, states will need to add infornation on their existing prison drug use problem, and update  that  information  annually.  All 50 state correctional  systems conducted  some form  of drug testing on their  inmates  last year;   yet no comprehensive data exists on the prevalence on drug use in state prisons.  Anecdotal  reports  have shown that certain systems, such as the District of Columbia's corrections department, have had difficulty  keeping  drugs out of prisons.   The baseline information they provide  will  help us to chart states' progress to reduce drug use and availability in their prisons.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. However, the passage provided does not appear to be a memorandum or letter between agencies or within an agency. It is a statement about a federal requirement for states to develop and implement plans for drug testing and intervention as a condition of receiving federal prison construction grants. It also discusses the need for states to provide baseline information on their existing prison drug use problem and update that information annually. This information is not protected under FOIA exemption 5 because it is not an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letter. There is no case law cited to support this conclusion as it is a straightforward application of the FOIA exemption 5 language.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; In order to provide additional resources for states to promote coerced abstinence and zero tolerance for drugs, the directive calls on the Attorney General to develop legislation to allow states to use their federal prison construction and treatment funds to carry out all of these activities.	"The statement may be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. Specifically, it may fall under the deliberative process privilege, which protects documents that are part of the decision-making process and contain opinions, recommendations, or advice. ; ; In this case, the directive appears to be a policy proposal or recommendation that is still in the process of being developed. It calls on the Attorney General to develop legislation, which suggests that the idea is not yet finalized or adopted. As such, it may be considered part of the agency's deliberative process and therefore exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.; ; One case that supports this reasoning is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that the deliberative process privilege protects documents that are ""predecisional"" and ""reflect the give-and-take of the consultative process."" Another relevant case is Public Citizen v. OMB (D.C. Cir. 1996), in which the court held that a memorandum containing recommendations and options for a proposed rule was protected under the deliberative process privilege because it was part of the agency's decision-making process. ; ; Overall, whether the statement is protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific context and content of the directive, as well as any other relevant factors."

"The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" The statement in question does not appear to be an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letter, but rather a proposal by the President for funding initiatives related to drug treatment and prevention.

The President's directive asks the Attorney General to work with states to increase their penalties for smuggling drugs into prisons.   Are there tough penalties for trafficking drugs into federal prisons?	"No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. However, the statement in question is a factual statement about the current state of penalties for drug trafficking in federal prisons and does not involve any inter-agency or intra-agency communication. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this scenario, but courts have consistently held that exemption 5 only applies to communications that are part of the decision-making process. For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 only applies to ""documents that are both predecisional and deliberative."" Since the statement in question is neither predecisional nor deliberative, it would not be protected under exemption 5."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; A.      Yes. The 1994 Omnibus Crime Act increased penalties for illegal drug use and smuggling drugs into Federal prisons.  for instance, drug trafficking in Federal prisons can now lead to imprisonment for up to 20 years for smuggling narcotics and methamphetamine, and up to 5 years for trafficking marijuana.

The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

The purpose of this exemption is to protect the decision-making process of government agencies by allowing them to freely exchange ideas and opinions without fear of public disclosure.; ; In this case, the summaries produced by Initiative staff and transmitted to the President are clearly intra-agency memorandums or letters. The purpose of these summaries is to provide the President with information and opinions gathered during Advisory Board meetings and Town Halls, which are likely to be sensitive and candid in nature. Disclosing these summaries could have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas and opinions within the Initiative, which would undermine the purpose of the exemption.; ; There is case law to support this conclusion. In NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 protects ""documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.""

Similarly, if the Workplace Diversity Forum or Corporate Executives Forum involved confidential discussions about personnel matters or proprietary business information, they may also be protected.; ; However, if the information is purely factual in nature and does not involve any privileged communications, it would not be protected under exemption 5. Additionally, even if the information is potentially protected, there may be other factors that weigh in favor of disclosure, such as the public interest in transparency and accountability.; ; There is no specific case law cited in this scenario, so it is difficult to provide a more detailed analysis.

The current immigration system is set up to favor keeping families intact. Thus, the vast number of legal immigrants are brought to this country through family-based visas, which do  not take into account education or skill level. The article cites a Rand  study proposal  to create a point system of immigration which continues to  give  weight  to  immediate  family  reunification but  would  also give points  for education, language  skills, and work experience. The final report of the Commission on Immigration Reform also recommends a shift  in priority toward  higher skilled immigrants.    Instead creating a point system, the Commission recommends revising skill-based admissions (approximately 100,000 visas) to favor highly-skilled and educated immigrants and eliminating altogether the category of unskilled workers. Though we think that these ideas are well worth exploring, it is unlikely that Congress will want to consider an overhaul of legal immigration this year.

However, it is important to note that many independent policy experts believe that payments to HMOs still are, on average, excessive given the fact that they continue to attract disproportionately healthy populations.  They believe that any movement towards reducing 2 benefits are more attributable to HMO ' s desire for adequate profit margins for their investors rather than adjustments in reimbursement issue. In fact, one corporate executive just informed us that Medicare continues to be their number one most profitable player. Having said that, the fact that the BBA is starting to reduce Medicare reimbursements to HMOs will clearly contribute to lower revenues for these health plans. It is important to note that the added benefits in Medicare HMO plans do help encourage beneficiaries to participate in these plans. The outstanding question is whether or not we want to allow payment rates to exceed what is necessary so as to ensure that these additional benefits are in place.

Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. However, this text does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it contain any privileged or confidential information. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. There is no case law necessary to support this conclusion as it is a straightforward application of the exemption.

However, without more information about the content of the record, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the requirements for exemption 5 protection.; ; Case law has established that for a communication to be protected under exemption 5, it must be both predecisional and deliberative. In other words, it must be created before a final decision has been made and must involve the exchange of opinions or recommendations related to that decision-making process. Additionally, the communication must be considered privileged, meaning that it is not subject to disclosure in the interest of effective government decision-making.; ; In this case, the record appears to be a note or email created by Russell W. Horwitz, a member of the Office of Presidential Personnel, and addressed to Elena Kagan, who is identified as a pager number. The subject and content of the communication are not provided, so it is impossible to determine whether it meets the requirements for exemption 5 protection.; ; However, it is worth noting that the fact that the record is labeled as ""Presidential"" may suggest that it is more likely to be considered privileged and therefore protected under exemption 5. The D.C. Circuit has held that communications involving the President or his immediate advisors are presumptively privileged and may be withheld under exemption 5 unless the requester can demonstrate a strong public interest in disclosure. See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Dep't of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108, 1114 (D.C.

FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. However, the text appears to be a simple message requesting a phone call and does not appear to involve any privileged or confidential information related to government agencies or their operations. Therefore, it is unlikely that exemption 5 would apply.; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this type of text message in the context of FOIA exemption 5. However, courts have generally interpreted exemption 5 narrowly and have required a showing of privilege or confidentiality in order for the exemption to apply. For example, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 866 (D.C. Cir. 1980), the court held that ""the burden is on the agency to establish that the material withheld falls within the scope of the claimed exemption"" and that ""exemptions from disclosure must be narrowly construed."" Based on this precedent, it is unlikely that the text message in question would be protected under exemption 5."

The court emphasized that the privilege applies to ""communications that are part of the decision-making process itself,"" and that the key question is whether the document ""reflects the give-and-take of the consultative process."" ; ; Overall, the determination of whether this record is protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific content and context of the document, as well as any other relevant factors such as the age of the record and the current state of the law regarding the deliberative process privilege."

However, based on my understanding of FOIA exemption 5, the message above may be protected under the deliberative process privilege. This exemption allows agencies to withhold documents that are part of the decision-making process, including pre-decisional communications, internal recommendations, and opinions. The message appears to be a communication between government officials discussing a specific policy issue (VAWA 245i), which could be considered part of the deliberative process.

Rice/OPD/EOP on ll/24/97 10:00 AM ---------------------------	It is unlikely that the text would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. The text does not appear to be either pre-decisional or deliberative, but rather a directive to have one person talk to another. Additionally, the text does not appear to be an inter-agency or intra-agency communication, as it involves individuals outside of the agency. Therefore, exemption 5 would not apply to this text.; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this type of text, but courts have generally interpreted exemption 5 narrowly and require a showing that the information is both pre-decisional and deliberative. For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 did not protect a memorandum that was not pre-decisional or deliberative, but rather was a final agency position. Similarly, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854 (D.C. Cir. 1980), the D.C. Circuit held that exemption 5 did not protect a document that was not pre-decisional or deliberative, but rather was a factual summary of events.

This means that the communication must be part of the decision-making process and contain opinions, recommendations, or advice. ; ; The statement provided does not appear to contain any opinions, recommendations, or advice. It is simply a factual statement about a conversation that took place. Therefore, it is unlikely that it would be protected under exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law that addresses this exact scenario, but courts have consistently held that exemption 5 only applies to communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. For example, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, the court held that ""the exemption is designed to protect the decision-making process, not the documents themselves."" Therefore, because the statement provided does not appear to be part of the decision-making process, it is unlikely that it would be protected under exemption 5."

Additionally, the text contains deliberative process information, which is protected under exemption 5. The Supreme Court case NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975) established that exemption 5 protects documents that are both predecisional and deliberative in nature. The text in question appears to be predecisional, as it is discussing the selection of individuals to meet with the President, and deliberative, as it is seeking input and reaction to ensure the meeting meets certain objectives.

The exemption covers documents that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature, such as drafts, recommendations, and opinions.; ; Without further information, it is difficult to determine whether the ""Child Care Proposal Automated Records Manr-i!"" would be protected under exemption 5.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; We are developing a child care proposal that will help working families afford child care, make targeted investments to improve the safety and quality of child care, particularly for infants and toddlers, and provide safe, constructive activities for school-age children. To help working families afford child care, the proposal: (1) increases funding for federal child care subsidies through the Child Care and Development Block Grant; and (2) changes the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit by raising the percentage of child care expenses  for which a  taxpayer may take a credit and by increasing the income levels of taxpayers who may  claim it. Currently, the credit rate is phased down from 30% for taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $10,000 or less to 20% for taxpayers with AGI above $28,000.  We are considering a series of options, including raising the credit rate from 50% for taxpayers with AGI of $30,000 to 20% for those with AGI above $59,000.)  We are also considering targeted investments to improve  the safety and quality of care.    First, the proposal adds funding to the scholarship program for child care providers, which you announced at the child care conference and  which has  received strong support. Second, it includes a new program that will ensure safety and healthy early learning and development for children in the critical first years. Third, the proposal provides resources for states to improve their enforcement of health and safety standards, and fourth, it funds parent education, research and technology. Finally, the proposal makes safe, constructive activities for youth during after-school hours more available by creating a new program for school age children and by coordinating existing programs.

The fact that the record was created by a member of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and sent to individuals within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) suggests that it may contain internal deliberations or advice that could be considered privileged. However, without more information about the content of the record, it is difficult to make a definitive determination.; ; One case that could be relevant to this analysis is In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729 (D.C. Cir. 1997), which established a three-part test for determining whether a document is protected under exemption 5. The test asks whether the document is (1) predecisional, meaning it was created before a final agency decision was made; (2) deliberative, meaning it reflects the agency's thought processes and decision-making; and (3) privileged, meaning it contains information that is typically protected by an evidentiary privilege, such as attorney-client or executive privilege. If all three elements are met, the document may be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.; ; Based on the limited information provided in the record description, it is possible that the document could meet the first two prongs of the Sealed Case test, as it was created by a member of the OSTP and appears to relate to internal discussions about food safety. However, it is unclear whether the document contains information that would be considered privileged under the third prong of the test. Further analysis would be necessary to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.

Case law has established that the exemption applies to communications that are both predecisional and deliberative, meaning they were created before a final decision was made and involve the exchange of opinions or recommendations. See, e.g., NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 150-51 (1975). If the communication in this record meets those criteria, it could be protected under exemption 5.; ; It is worth noting that the fact that the record was created by a presidential official does not automatically make it exempt from disclosure. While communications involving the President himself may be privileged, communications among White House staff are subject to the same analysis as communications within any other agency. See, e.g., Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 1 F.3d 1274, 1290 (D.C. Cir. 1993)."

FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The announcement does not fall under this category as it is a public statement made by the administration and not an internal communication between agencies or within an agency.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Background In January, 1994 President Clinton established the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) to examine reports that the government had supported unethical human radiation experiments and releases of radiation during the Cold War.  He asked ACHRE to uncover the truth, recommend ways to right past wrongs, and suggest ways to make sure the government will not repeat past mistakes.	The information related to the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This is because the committee was established by the President and was tasked with examining potentially sensitive and confidential information related to government-supported human radiation experiments. The committee's work likely involved internal deliberations and communications that would fall under the protection of exemption 5.; ; One case that supports this conclusion is Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2004), in which the court held that communications between a government agency and a presidential advisory committee were protected under exemption 5. The court reasoned that the committee was acting as an agent of the agency and that the communications were therefore privileged. Similarly, in Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, 97 F.3d 575 (D.C. Cir. 1996), the court held that communications between a presidential advisory committee and the White House were protected under exemption 5.; ; Overall, the sensitive nature of the ACHRE's work and the fact that it was established by the President suggest that its communications and deliberations would be protected under exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Io October, 1995 ACHRE issued its report. ACHRE found that the-government had conducted several thousand human radiation experiments from 1945 to 1975 and that the majority advanced biomedical research. The Committee found, however, that some were conducted unethically. For example, scientists injected plutonium into 18 patients without their knowledge, and researchers conducted experiments on indigent patients and children. ACHRE made 18 recommendations to open the public record, protect human subjects of future research, and compensate those wronged by the government's actions.	The passage provided would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The passage provided does not contain any inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters. Therefore, FOIA exemption 5 would not apply. ; ; Additionally, the passage provided contains information about the findings and recommendations of the ACHRE report on human radiation experiments conducted by the government. This information would likely be subject to disclosure under FOIA's presumption of openness, which requires agencies to disclose information unless it falls under one of the nine exemptions or is otherwise prohibited by law. ; ; There is no need to cite case law to support this conclusion as it is a straightforward application of FOIA's exemptions and presumption of openness.

The report summarizes actions to address ACHRE's 18 recommendations.	The announcement would likely not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. However, the announcement does not appear to involve any such communications. Rather, it is a summary of actions taken in response to a committee's recommendations. As such, it is more akin to a final agency action or a factual report, which are not protected under exemption 5. ; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this scenario, but courts have generally held that exemption 5 does not apply to purely factual information or final agency actions. For example, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854 (D.C. Cir. 1980), the court held that a final report on oil and gas leasing was not protected under exemption 5 because it was not pre-decisional or deliberative. Similarly, in Tax Analysts v. IRS, 117 F.3d 607 (D.C. Cir. 1997), the court held that a final revenue ruling was not protected under exemption 5 because it was not pre-decisional or deliberative.

ACHRE recommended the government compensate the families of 18 subjects of plutonium injection experiments. The government has settled with all 16 families that came forward.	"Yes, the above statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The announcement of the settlement and the number of families compensated could be considered internal agency communications that are part of the decision-making process and therefore privileged. ; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (421 U.S. 132, 1975), in which the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 covers ""intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" The settlement announcement could be considered an intra-agency communication that would not be available to the public or other parties outside of the agency. ; ; Additionally, the settlement may involve sensitive personal information about the families and individuals involved, which could also be protected under FOIA exemption 6, which covers personal privacy. However, without more information about the specific details of the settlement and the context in which the announcement was made, it is difficult to make a definitive determination about the applicability of FOIA exemptions."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ;     • President Clinton signed a memorandum to strengthen the rights and protections of people participating in secret, government-supported research. ACHRE recommended that subjects of secret experiments have special protections and information. Acting on that recommendation, the President directed agencies today to propose new rules for secret research that would require scientists to: obtain informed consent from all potential subjects of all secret experiments (current rules allow researchers to waive informed consent in certain cases); disclose the identity of the sponsoring agency to potential subjects; and tell potential subjects that an experiment is classified. The new rules would also establish a more independent review process; require the head of the agency conducting secret human research to approve each project; and require permanent records of secret experiments. The President also directed federal agencies to report annually on the number of classified human research projects and the number of subjects in each project. A preliminary review by the Administration's human radiation lnteragency Working Group indicates that the government is not supporting any classified human research at this time; today's directive initiates a formal, routine accounting of secret human studies.	The information described in this passage would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. This passage describes a memorandum signed by President Clinton and directives given to federal agencies, which are not inter-agency or intra-agency communications. Additionally, the information described in the passage pertains to government-supported research and the rights of research subjects, which is a matter of public interest and not subject to exemption 5. There is no case law cited as this is a straightforward application of the exemption.

Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ;     • The Administration announced proposed amendments to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 to compensate hundreds of uranium miners who would not be compensated under current law. ACHRE found that some deserving miners do not qualify for compensation under the Act. The amendments would establish fairer, science­ based criteria for compensation. The Administration will also propose regulatory changes to RECA to facilitate claims processing.	The information provided would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. However, the information provided in this scenario is a public announcement made by the Administration regarding proposed amendments to a federal law and regulatory changes. This information does not fall under the scope of exemption 5 as it is not an inter-agency or intra-agency communication that is privileged or confidential.; ; Case law that supports this conclusion includes Milner v. Department of Navy (2011), where the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 only applies to materials that are both predecisional and deliberative. In this scenario, the information provided is not predecisional or deliberative, but rather a public announcement of proposed amendments and regulatory changes.

In that case, the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 protects from disclosure materials that are ""predecisional"" and ""deliberative"" in nature, meaning that they were created before a final decision was made and were part of the agency's decision-making process. The Court reasoned that disclosure of such materials would inhibit frank and open discussion within the agency and would harm the quality of agency decision-making.; ; If the previous and ongoing actions described in Building Public Trust involve predecisional and deliberative materials, then they may be protected under exemption 5.

The Administration has made 300,000 fully searchable pages of documents available on the Internet, and will add an additional 200,000 pages shortly. The Departments of Energy and Defense have published document search guides.     • The President signed Executive Order 12958 directing Federal agencies to review and declassify thousands of documents, including documents on radiation experiments.	"No, the actions described in this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The actions described in this statement involve the transfer of documents to the National Archives, the publication of document search guides, and the signing of an executive order to review and declassify documents. These actions do not involve privileged or confidential communications between agencies or within an agency. Therefore, they would not be protected under exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this statement, but courts have consistently held that exemption 5 applies only to privileged or confidential communications. For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 applies only to materials that are ""predecisional"" and ""deliberative"" in nature, and that are ""normally privileged in the civil discovery context."" Similarly, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854 (D.C. Cir. 1980), the D.C. Circuit held that exemption 5 applies only to materials that are ""intra-agency or inter-agency in character"" and that are ""predecisional and deliberative in nature.""

Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Actions to Protect human subjects in the future.     • President Clinton established the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) to examine bioethical issues, including human research issues. A subcommittee of NBAC will address certain broad questions raised by ACHRE, including how to strengthen Institutional Review Boards -- the local ethics panels for Federally-sponsored research.     • In October, 1995 President Clinton directed agencies to develop plans to improve their oversight of ethics rules. The agencies have completed their review and upgraded protections, and NBAC will review agency procedures in the coming months.     • Agencies have undertaken nationwide education efforts to raise the profile of ethical considerations, and are funding research to improve our understanding of informed consent.	"It is possible that these actions could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" This exemption is often used to protect pre-decisional and deliberative communications within the government.; ; In this case, the actions described involve internal discussions and reviews of ethical considerations and research oversight within government agencies. These discussions may involve the exchange of memorandums or letters that could be considered pre-decisional or deliberative. Additionally, the involvement of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission suggests that these discussions may be part of a larger, ongoing process of policy development and review.; ; However, it is important to note that FOIA exemption 5 is not an absolute protection, and courts have recognized that there may be circumstances where the public interest in disclosure outweighs the government's interest in confidentiality. For example, in the case of National Wildlife Federation v. United States Forest Service, the court held that ""the deliberative process privilege must give way when the material sought is essential to the fair resolution of a significant public controversy and there is no other source for the information."" Therefore, if there were a compelling public interest in disclosure of these actions, it is possible that exemption 5 could be overcome.; ; Overall, while these actions may be protected under FOIA exemption 5, the specific circumstances of each communication or document would need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether it qualifies for protection."

Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are both predecisional and deliberative in nature. This means that the record must be created before a decision is made and must contain opinions, recommendations, or advice related to the decision-making process.; ; Without knowing the content of the record, it is impossible to determine whether it meets these criteria.

In this case, the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 protects documents that are both predecisional and deliberative in nature, even if they are not ultimately used in the decision-making process. The Court also emphasized that the exemption is intended to protect the decision-making process itself, rather than the final decision.; ; Therefore, if the mentioned record contains predecisional and deliberative information related to a decision-making process, it may be protected under exemption 5.

The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of the President's involvement and the need for an explanation suggest that this is an internal communication between government officials discussing the potential release of an executive order. The case of NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975) established that exemption 5 covers communications that are both predecisional and deliberative, meaning they were made before a final decision was reached and were part of the decision-making process.

D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; WASHINGTON (AP) President Clinton took steps today to protect those who participate in secret, government-sponsored experiments from mistreatment and assure they are fully informed of the risks. The administration also said it has settled the last of a number of claims, totalling $6.5 million, from families of civilians who were injected with plutonium or uranium as part of secret experiments in the 1940s. The actions are• • designed to increase public trust ... and make our government accountable to the American people,"" said Energy Secretary Federico Pena, whose department has spearheaded the public review of past radiation experiments. Pena said the administration also will ask Congress to expand a program that provides compensation to uranium miners who were exposed to radiation as part of the government nuclear weapons program. He said up to 600 additional miners would be compensated at a cost of about $ 50 million. The plans for giving greater protection to research participants were prompted by recommendations more than a year ago by a presidential commission that investigated the government's use of humans in radiation research during the Cold War years. The advisory panel warned that past excesses might be repeated unless there are new safeguards. The White House said today that Clinton had signed a memorandum ,; strengthening the rights and protections afforded individuals who agree to be subjects of secret, government-supported research. The White House said a review by an interagency task force uncovered no government-supported classified human research at this time. But officials acknowledged that formal accounting for such research needs to be improved. Meanwhile, the White House said it had settled claims with four additional families of 1B individuals who were given plutonium injections as part of 1940s experiments. One victim has not been located and the family of another does not want compensation, said Tara O'Toole, DOE's assistant secretary for environment, safety and health. Associate  Attorney  General  John Dwyer  said the 16 claims        12 of which  totalling  $4.B million  were  made  public last November  total $6.5 million. The government has said it is prepared to provide compensation to the families of 52 other individuals who the advisory commission said were believed to be subjected to improper radiation experiments. The identity of those 52 are not known, and so far no families have come forward, according to the White House. Under the new presidential directive on human research, agencies must develop new rules that clearly require scientists to obtain informed consent from all potential subjects of secret experiments. Currently, such consent may be waived under some circumstances. The president also ordered that any research subject be told the identity of the sponsoring agency and whether the experimentation is classified. The new rules also would require the head of the agency to approve such research and develop a more independent review process than currently provided. Also in response to the October 1995 findings by the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, the president said he will: Ask Congress to broaden a 1990 law that allows compensation to underground uranium miners who became ill because of exposure to radiation. Under current law, hundreds of miners are ineligible for compensation. Will propose legislation to make veterans' health care benefits available to airmen and sailors who were subjects of radioactive nasal treatments more than 50 years ago. The treatments were to prevent broken eardrums during flight or in submarines. Will seek broader epidemiological studies to determine the long-term health impact of nuclear bomb testing during the Cold War to military personnel and civilian populations near the test areas.

"It is unlikely that the question ""How many experiments does this include?"" would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. However, the question does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it contain any privileged or confidential information. Therefore, it is unlikely that exemption 5 would apply.; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this question, as it is a relatively straightforward inquiry that does not involve any sensitive or confidential information. However, courts have generally interpreted exemption 5 narrowly, and have emphasized that it should not be used to shield information that is not truly privileged or confidential. For example, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 866 (D.C. Cir. 1980), the court held that ""the deliberative process privilege is not a broad, general privilege against disclosure of all agency records that reflect deliberative processes,"" and that agencies must demonstrate a specific harm that would result from disclosure in order to justify withholding information under exemption 5. Similarly, in National Wildlife Federation v. United States Forest Service, 861 F.2d 1114, 1118 (9th Cir. 1988), the court held that ""the deliberative process privilege is not absolute, and must be balanced against the public interest in disclosure.""

Generally, the Committee found that researchers obtained consent from healthy subjects, but not from patient-subjects. The Advisory Committee did look more broadly at issues of informed consent across the government and found that the government did not have comprehensive policies in place before 1974. Although the government has strengthen informed consent procedures significantly since 1974, the Committee recommended -- and the Administration is taking -- additional steps to improve informed consent, including requiring informed consent in all classified research (eliminating a current waiver provision) and studying further the informed consent process.

FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are privileged and would not be available to a party in litigation. The question does not fall under this category and is not related to any privileged communication between agencies or within an agency. Therefore, FOIA exemption 5 would not apply to this question.; ; Case law: In National Labor Relations Board v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (421 U.S. 132, 149 (1975)), the Supreme Court held that FOIA exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are privileged and would not be available to a party in litigation.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; A: A strong system of Federal oversight, education, and sanctions is currently in place to ensure the protection of the subjects of government sponsored human research. The Administration has taken a number of steps to further strengthen protections for human subjects based on the Advisory Committee's recommendations. For example, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission is reviewing Institutional Review Board policies -- IRBs are the local boards that review the ethics of individual research projects. And today the President signed a directive to protect subjects of classified research.	Yes, the statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing internal government policies and actions related to human research protections, which could be considered privileged information. Additionally, the statement references the National Bioethics Advisory Commission and a presidential directive, both of which could be considered privileged communications within the government. ; ; One case that supports this conclusion is Public Citizen Health Research Group v. NIH, in which the court held that certain documents related to the government's oversight of human research were protected under exemption 5 because they contained privileged communications between agencies.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; The Administration is also working to improve the informed consent process. Despite the vigor with which all parties embrace the informed consent process, the Advisory Committee found that little is actually known about the effectiveness of this transaction between researcher and prospective subject. In response, the NIH and the Departments of Energy and Veterans Affairs are initiating research to develop new knowledge about the informed consent process.	The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement discusses ongoing research initiatives by multiple government agencies, which could be considered internal deliberations or pre-decisional communications. Additionally, the statement suggests that the agencies are actively working to improve their informed consent processes, which could be considered part of their decision-making process and therefore exempt from disclosure.; ; One case that supports this conclusion is Public Citizen Health Research Group v. NIH, in which the court held that documents related to ongoing research initiatives were exempt from disclosure under exemption 5 because they were part of the agency's decision-making process and contained pre-decisional communications.

The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. However, the statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency that is part of a decision-making process. Rather, it is a question posed to an individual or entity about their plans and priorities. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5. There is no specific case law cited as this is a straightforward application of the exemption.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; A: No. the National Bioethics Advisory Commission has already established an ambitious plan of work to address the current status of Federal protection for human research subjects. The work will proceed in parallel with the special assignment on cloning. NBAC is planning to issue a report to the President and to Congress in October and hopes that little or no delay will be incurred as a result of the additional work.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. The statement does not appear to be a communication between government agencies or within a single agency, nor does it involve any pre-decisional or deliberative information. Rather, it is a statement of fact about the National Bioethics Advisory Commission's plans and hopes for their work on human research subjects and cloning. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law cited to support this conclusion, as the statement is relatively straightforward and does not involve any complex legal issues. However, the general principles of FOIA exemption 5 and its application to inter-agency and intra-agency communications are well-established in case law, including the seminal case of NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975).
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Q: What is being done to provide compensation in connection with the human radiation experiments?	The answer to this question may be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and deliberative process privilege. The answer may involve discussions or decisions related to compensation for the human radiation experiments, which could be considered part of the agency's deliberative process. ; ; However, whether or not the answer is protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case. For example, if the agency has already made a final decision on compensation and the answer simply provides factual information about the implementation of that decision, it may not be protected under exemption 5. ; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses whether the answer to this question would be protected under exemption 5. However, there are cases that have established the scope and limitations of the deliberative process privilege. For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., the Supreme Court held that the privilege only applies to documents that are both predecisional and deliberative in nature, meaning they were created before a final decision was made and contain opinions, recommendations, or advice related to that decision. ; ; Overall, whether the answer to this question is protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case, and would require a careful analysis of the agency's decision-making process and the nature of the information being requested.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; A: The Advisory Committee recommended the government compensate or consider compensate subjects of certain biomedical experiments. The Department of Justice has worked closely with other Departments to resolve individual claims. As announced today, the Administration has resolved all claims brought forward for experiments the Advisory Committee specifically identified for compensation. The Administration has settled with families of 16 plutonium injection subjects. The plutonium injection cases were singled out by the Advisory Committee as being particularly troubling ethically and deserving of compensation because efforts were made by the government to keep information secret from the subjects or their families to avoid government liabilities or embarrassment. The Advisory Committee also identified two other experiments for compensation (see Recommendation 1 ), but the subjects of those experiments are unknown.	"Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language used in the passage suggests that the Department of Justice and other departments worked closely together to resolve individual claims, which could be considered privileged communications. Additionally, the passage references the Advisory Committee's recommendations, which may also be considered privileged communications. ; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1978), in which the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 covers ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" The Court noted that the exemption is intended to protect the ""decision-making processes of government agencies,"" which could include communications related to the resolution of claims or the implementation of recommendations. ; ; Overall, the language used in the passage suggests that the information is likely protected under exemption 5, but a more detailed analysis would be necessary to make a definitive determination."

That fact-finding continues in a number of these cases. [Refer detailed questions to DoJ].	"Yes, the statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing ongoing internal deliberations and investigations related to potential compensation for certain experiments, which could be considered privileged information. ; ; One case that supports this conclusion is Schiller v. NLRB, 964 F.2d 1205 (D.C. Cir. 1992), in which the court held that exemption 5 protected internal agency communications related to an ongoing investigation. The court noted that the exemption is intended to protect the ""decision-making processes of government agencies"" and that disclosure of such information could ""chill the frank and open discussion necessary for effective agency decision-making."" ; ; Therefore, the statement about ongoing fact-finding related to potential compensation for certain experiments would likely be protected under exemption 5."

Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Some populations exposed to radiation releases studied by the Committee are already eligible for compensation under existing law, including atomic vets and uranium miners. The Committee recommended certain changes to these programs. The Administration has reviewed and acted on those recommendations. For example, today we are announcing new legislation to improve compensation for uranium miners.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

This could potentially apply to the record in question if it contains information about interviews or other deliberations related to the formulation of government policies or decisions.; ; However, it is also worth noting that exemption 5 is not an absolute protection and must be balanced against the public interest in disclosure. As such, even if the record is found to be protected under exemption 5, it may still be subject to release if the public interest in disclosure outweighs the government's interest in keeping the information confidential."

Your thoughts helped to stimulate a productive discussion with DOJ on alternative approaches.	"The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be a communication between two agencies (the requester and DOJ) and references a discussion about alternative approaches, which suggests the communication was part of a deliberative process. This type of communication is typically protected under exemption 5 to encourage open and candid discussions within agencies. ; ; Case law that supports this conclusion includes NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975), which established the ""deliberative process privilege"" under exemption 5. This privilege protects communications that are part of the decision-making process within an agency, including those that are predecisional and deliberative in nature. The privilege is intended to protect the quality of agency decision-making by allowing agency officials to freely exchange ideas and opinions without fear of public disclosure."

We are still planning a Tuesday press conference.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. However, the statement in question does not appear to fall under any of these categories. It is simply a communication about a press conference and does not involve any privileged or confidential information. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this exact scenario, but courts have generally interpreted FOIA exemption 5 narrowly and have required agencies to demonstrate that the information at issue falls within one of the specific categories of privileged or confidential communications. For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), the Supreme Court held that the deliberative process privilege only applies to materials that are both predecisional and deliberative in nature. Similarly, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854 (D.C. Cir. 1980), the D.C. Circuit held that the attorney-client privilege only applies to communications that are made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. These cases demonstrate that FOIA exemption 5 is not a broad catch-all exemption and that agencies must be able to demonstrate that the information at issue falls within one of the specific categories of privileged or confidential communications in order to withhold it from disclosure.

The information described in the statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. Specifically, the information may fall under the deliberative process privilege, which protects documents that are part of the decision-making process and contain opinions, recommendations, or advice. ; ; In this case, the information pertains to medical experiments and treatments that were conducted without the knowledge or consent of the patients involved. It is likely that there were internal communications and discussions within the agencies involved regarding the ethical and legal implications of these actions.

FDA, 704 F.2d 1280 (D.C. Cir. 1983). In this case, the court held that the deliberative process privilege applied to internal FDA documents related to the approval of a drug, as they contained opinions and recommendations regarding the drug's safety and efficacy. Similarly, the internal communications and discussions related to the medical experiments and treatments described in the statement would likely be protected under exemption 5.

This exemption applies to documents that are both predecisional and deliberative in nature, meaning they were created before a final decision was made and contain opinions, recommendations, or advice related to that decision-making process.; ; In this case, the memorandum is addressed to a member of the Domestic Policy Council and concerns proposed changes to the RECA. The subject matter suggests that the document is likely predecisional, as it is seeking a decision from the recipient by a specific deadline. Additionally, the fact that it is a memorandum from one individual to another within the same agency suggests that it is an intra-agency communication.; ; There is case law to support the application of exemption 5 to similar documents. For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975), the Supreme Court held that predecisional and deliberative documents were protected under exemption 5, even if they were not ultimately relied upon in making a final decision. Similarly, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy (1981), the Court held that the exemption applied to documents that were part of the agency's decision-making process, even if they were not directly related to a specific decision.; ; Therefore, it is likely that the memorandum would be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

The Court explained that the purpose of the exemption is to protect the ""decision-making processes of government agencies"" by allowing for frank and open discussions among agency officials without fear of public disclosure.; ; Therefore, the discussion of whether or not to propose compensation for uranium miners with lung cancer would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; BACKGROUND: From the 1940s to the 1960s the United States' nuclear weapons program relied on uranium from mines in the Southwestern United States. Miners working in those mines were exposed to levels of radiation known to be dangerous  because the  United States did not ensure that the mines were adequately ventilated. As a result hundreds of miners contracted or will contract fatal lung cancer.	It is possible that the information related to the United States' nuclear weapons program and the lack of ventilation in the mines could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications and deliberative process materials. However, this would depend on the specific documents being requested and whether they contain information that is pre-decisional or deliberative in nature.; ; If the documents contain information related to the government's decision-making process regarding the ventilation of the mines, or if they contain communications between government officials discussing the issue, they may be protected under exemption 5. However, if the documents contain factual information about the dangers of radiation exposure and the government's knowledge of those dangers, they may not be protected under exemption 5.; ; Case law that may support the application of exemption 5 in this context includes NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975), which established that exemption 5 covers materials that are both pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. However, the Supreme Court has also held that exemption 5 should be narrowly construed and that it does not cover purely factual information that is not part of the decision-making process (see EPA v. Mink, 1973). Therefore, whether the information related to the uranium mines would be protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific nature of the documents being requested.

This would depend on the specific content and context of the proposal, as well as the degree to which it reflects internal deliberations and decision-making processes within the IAWG and other agencies involved.; ; If the proposed legislation primarily consists of internal deliberations and recommendations among agency officials, it could be considered an intra-agency memorandum or letter and thus potentially exempt from FOIA disclosure. However, if the proposal includes significant input or feedback from external stakeholders or public sources, it may be less likely to qualify for exemption 5 protection.; ; There is some case law that supports the application of exemption 5 to agency proposals or recommendations. For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co.

Similarly, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. DOE (617 F.2d 854, 1980), the Fifth Circuit held that a proposed rulemaking document was exempt from FOIA disclosure under exemption 5 because it reflected internal agency deliberations and was not a final agency action.; ; Overall, the application of exemption 5 to the proposed legislation developed by the IAWG would depend on the specific content and context of the proposal, as well as the degree to which it reflects internal deliberations and recommendations among agency officials."

The decision on this issue, however, is unlikely to affect the overall reception of the Administration's response  to ACHRE.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process.

As such, it would not be protected under exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this issue, as it is a matter of interpreting the language and intent of the FOIA exemption. However, courts have generally held that exemption 5 applies only to communications that are part of the decision-making process, and not to other types of information or analysis. For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 did not apply to a report prepared by an agency's staff that was not part of the decision-making process.

No, the proposed amendment to RECA would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.

Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; It is our understanding that the rationale for these proposed amendments is to more nearly equalize the treatment of uranium miners and downwinders. Scientific evidence indicates that downwinders were exposed to much lower levels of radiation and, therefore, a much smaller increased risk of cancer, than were uranium miners. Therefore, the argument goes, it is unfair to allow downwinders whose probability of causation is below 50% to recover compensation while denying such recovery to uranium miners.	"The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

We would draw the policy line short of providing recovery for persons who probably were not injured by the government activities involved. The rule in litigation is that those who sue the government for injuries caused by governmental action must prove that the injuries were caused by the governmental action. [This standard is encompassed in 28 use 1346(b)] In many of these cases the plaintiffs may have a sympathetic case but lack the evidence to prove causation by the preponderance standard.

Reilly Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal NEW YORK - Golden Books Family Entertainment, the struggling children's book publisher, was dealt another blow as its president and second-in-<:ommand, Eric Ellenbogen, resigned unexpectedly to take a job as president and chief executive officer of Marvel Enterprises Inc. Mr. Ellenbogen, 41 years old, came to the company in 1996 as president of its entertainment group, a television and video-based unit. In June, he was named president of the entire company, acting as No. 2 to Richard E. Snyder, the parent's 65-year-old chairman and chief executive. At Marvel, he succeeds Joseph Ahearn, who previously said he would resign as soon as a successor was named. Marvel Enterprises was created in October when Marvel Entertainment Group Inc. emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and merged with Toy Biz Inc. It owns the rights to several comic-book characters including ""Spidennan,"" 11X-Men"" and ""Men in Black,"" as well as Fleer/Skybox, a trading-card maker, and the Panini stickers business. Mr. Ellenbogen was credited with building Broadway Video, a television production and distribution company, which Golden Books acquired in 1996. He directed Broadway's acquisition of crucial film and television libraries, including titles such as ""Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" and ""Lassie."" The company said Mr. Snyder now will directly oversee the entertainment unit, which includes home video, merchandising and licensing. Golden Books' nine-month net loss widened sharply to $70.3 million, or $2.77 a share, and revenue fell to $142 million from $ f70 million. It recently reached a preliminary standstill agreement with a group of bondholders to put off interest payments on $100 million in debt. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Golden Books said there is ""substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern."" The company has warned that possible ""restructuring, reduction of costs and other actions"" could result in substantial year-end charges. Earlier this month, it was notified by the Nasdaq Stock Market about the possible delisting of the company's stock for failure to maintain a closing price of at least $5. The shares could be delisted . as early as Dec. 11, though the company says it plans to ""work with the Nasdaq"" to ensure its continued listing. Shares of Golden Books fell 6.25 cents to 43.75 cents in Nasdaq trading, close to a 52-week low. Marvel rose 6.25 cents to $5.9375 in composite New York Stock Exchange trading. Golden Books said Mr. Ellenbogen won't be replaced and said it will be ""streamlining"" its organization. The company said it will be ""finalizing"" its senior management in the next several weeks."

Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Credit Markets: With Market Turmoil in the Rearview Mirror, Corporations Drive Forward With Bond Issues By Catherine Valenti and Tom Sullivan Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal Corporations of all stripes rushed to raise money in the bond market, including issuers who just six weeks ago wouldn't have stood a chance of raising funds.   As confidence  continued after the recent financial turmoil, problem-plagued ftanchis marketing company Cendant Corp. sold $1.55 billion ofbon increasing the size from a planned $500 million in response t strong investor demand. In addition, two telecommunications companies sold junk-rated securities to finance the construction new networks. Level 3 Communications Inc., which is using Internet technology, came to market with $500 million of zero-coupon bonds, while Global Crossing Holdings Ltd. sold $500 million of preferred stock to help finance its international fiber-optic links. Despite the rush, there is little sign the current flood of bond issuance will ease. It emerged yesterday that the Seagram Co. is lining up a giant debt offering, likely to come to market in December. Lead manager Goldman, Sachs & Co. is marketing the deal at a size of $2 billion. But there is widespread expectation among people looking at the transaction that the total could be raised to $2.5 billion to $4 billion. Goldman declined to comment on whether the size would be increased. No official confirmation of the use of proceeds was available. However Montreal-based Seagram is completing its acquisition of entertainment company PolyGrarn NV. The acquisition is valued in excess of$10 billion and is expected  to close  Dec. 4. With issuance rapidly making up any ground lost in September and early October, worries about a credit crunch are easing, though some participants say the real test will come after Thanksgiving with Seagram's deal and the $2.5 billion anticipated from Monsanto Co., announced two weeks ago. ""The supply overhang that we saw all year is coming to the market and deals are getting done,"" said Greg Hahn, senior vice president and fixed-income portfolio manager at Conseco Capital Management. ""That's a very healthy sign for the market  right now."" The key to Cendant's deal was the high yield on offer, according to investors. That helped to overcome worries about the accounting scandal that has plagued the company this year. ""Obviously  the company has had its accounting problems, but you can't  beat"" the yield on offer relative to Treasurys, said John Kowalik, senior vice president and portfolio manager at Oppenheimer Funds. ""If you're a yield  buyer, this would qualify as a candidate."" Lead underwriters Chase Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co. said that even at the increased size, demand outstripped  the bonds available.   The company so/d $400 million of two-year notes at a yield 2.875 percentage points more than comparable Treasurys and $1.15 billion of five-year notes at a yield 3.125 percentage points more than Treasurys.    During the four-day roadshow to market the bond deal, syndicate officials said Cendant focused on the strength of its core businesses and strategy. For much of this year, the company's public image has been beset by an accounting scandal that took place at direct marketer CUC International, which merged with HFS Inc. to form Cendant in late 1997. As a further enticement, Cendant  will increase the coupon on the bond deal by 1.5 percentage points if its ratings are downgraded to junk status by both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's. Currently it is rated Baal by Moody's and triple-B by S&P. In the junk market, Global Crossing's offering of senior exchangeable pay-in-kind preferred securities was doubled from its originally planned size. The securities were priced at par with a 10.5% dividend rate. Level 3's deal was its second offering this year. It sold $3 billion of junk bonds in April and these securities have become a market favorite. During the financial crisis of mid-August to mid-October, ""Level 3 became the only bond you could sell because it was a high-yield benchmark,"" said Jerry Paul, high-yield fund manager Invesco Funds Group, ""and it was knocked down unduly."" Level 3, which has a $10 billion capital plan, ""saw a nice window to get some funds and got the money,"" said one person familiar with the deal. Neither Level 3 officials nor lead underwriter Salomon Smith Barney would comment. Here are the details of yesterday's two-year note auction.

First, it creates criminal sanctions for organizations or individuals who knowingly and willfully engage  in a pattern of  physical  or mental harm to residents. Second, it would create civil penalties that could be imposed on individuals, facility chains, or management companies if they engage in conduct that results in a pattern of  physical  or mental harm to residents. Third,  it would authorize  DOJ to seek injunctive  relief  against these entities or individuals whenever DOJ has reason to suspect  that  they are engaging  in behavior  that  will  result in harm to physical or mental harm to residents. DOJ would have to consult  with HHS before invoking  its injunctive authority.	The summary of the proposed legislation would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are privileged and would not be available to a party in litigation with the agency.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; OUTSTANDING ISSUES HHS is primarily concerned about the overlap in enforcement  authority  that these  new provisions would create. As currently drafted, the only area of facility noncompliance that would not pose the problem of overlapping authority for both agencies would be those cases where violations are minimal  or where the harm to residents is isolated. HHS is concerned  that  in situations  where both agencies have an interest in initiating an enforcement action, DOJ will push HCFA to delay its enforcement action, since DOJ's need  to build a solid case for conviction  may not coincide  with  HCFA's  need to act swiftly when needed. In addition, HHS is concerned that  DOJ  will develop  its own quality standards for individual facilities and chains when deciding whether to initiate prosecution, thus requiring facilities to comply with one set of standards developed by HCFA  and another  set of standards developed by DOJ.	The passage would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the deliberative process. The passage discusses concerns and considerations related to the enforcement of new provisions, and reflects the internal deliberations and decision-making processes of HHS and DOJ. As such, it would likely be considered pre-decisional and deliberative, and therefore exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.; ; Case law that supports this conclusion includes NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1978), which established that exemption 5 covers documents that are both pre-decisional and deliberative, and that the exemption is intended to protect the quality of agency decision-making by allowing for frank and open internal discussions. Other cases, such as Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy (1981) and Jordan v. United States Department of Justice (1997), have further clarified the scope of exemption 5 and the types of documents that are covered.
D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; DOJ feels that the overlap in enforcement authority is limited to enforcement action in individual facilities. Currently, no one has the authority to prosecute nursing home chains for repeated violations, which this statute would provide to DOJ.

"The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

The Court explained that the exemption is intended to protect the ""decision-making processes of government agencies"" by allowing agency officials to freely exchange ideas and opinions without fear of public disclosure. ; ; In this case, the statement appears to be a communication between DOJ officials discussing the agency's enforcement authority and policy considerations.

Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; PROPOSED DPC POSITION Modify the DOJ proposal to limit their new enforcement authority to criminal violations and require HHS to propose new legislation providing the111 with new authority to impose civil penalties. Under this option, the Department of Justice would be allowed to impose new criminal penalties on individuals, facility chains, and management companites who knowingly and willfully engage in a patterns of physical or mental harm to residents. HHS would propose new  legislation creating civil penalties that could be imposed on individuals,  facility chains, or management  companies if they engage in conduct that results in a pattern of physical or mental harm to residents. This compromise provides virtually the same level of enforcement and eliminates the problematic overlap of authority created by the DOJ proposal.	The proposed DPC position would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The position is a proposal for internal agency action and contains recommendations for changes to legislation and enforcement authority. As such, it is likely to be considered pre-decisional and deliberative, and therefore exempt from disclosure under exemption 5. ; ; This conclusion is supported by case law such as NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), which established that exemption 5 protects documents that are both pre-decisional and deliberative.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Inclusion in Crime Bill. As a matter of perception, we believe there is a danger in housing a nursing home quality provision  jn the  crime bill.  Nursing home resident advocates have raised concerns that nursing home enforcement should, in general, be a quality issue, not a crime issue. We recommend pulling the nursing home provision out of the crime bill end sending it up es a stand-alone bill.	The inclusion of the nursing home provision in the crime bill would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, the statement in question does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it involve any deliberative process. It is a recommendation made by the author based on their perception and the concerns raised by nursing home resident advocates. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this issue. However, in general, FOIA exemption 5 has been interpreted narrowly by courts, and the burden is on the agency to demonstrate that the information falls within the exemption. In this case, it is unlikely that the agency could demonstrate that the inclusion of the nursing home provision in the crime bill is a deliberative process that would be harmed by disclosure.

"The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Referral. The bill would give DOJ the authority to pursue nursing homes without referral from HCFA. We believe this would create significant overlap between HCFA's and DOJ's enforcement . actions and could impede HCFA's actions to improve quality. We are also concerned  that, because  DOJ would exercise its authority through its US Attorney's offices, there would not be a consistent application of quality standards. We recommend that DOJ have the authority to pursue nursing homes only upon referral from HCFA or with the explicit approval of HCFA.

Another relevant case is Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854 (D.C.

D1			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Chains vs. Individual Facilities. The bill would give DOJ civil authority to pursue both nursing home chains and individual facilities. We believe HCFA should have primary civil authority in cases involving individual facilities, and we recommend that ives DOJ civil aut onty over individual facilities.  DOJ would continue to have civil authority through the False Claims Act, upon referral from HCFA. DOJ's  proposal  would impede HCFA's ability  to en'fori:e quality through CMPs, including the use of HCFA's new CMP per-instance CMP authority. For nursing home chains, we believe DOJ should have civil authority to pursue nursing home chains only upon referral from HCFA or with the explicit approval of HCFA.	"Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the deliberative process. The language in this passage suggests that it is part of an internal discussion or recommendation about how to allocate civil authority between DOJ and HCFA in cases involving nursing homes. The passage includes opinions and recommendations about which agency should have primary civil authority and how CMPs should be used, which are likely part of the agencies' deliberative process. ; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 covers ""opinions, recommendations, and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.""

An important way to improve the quality of nursing homes is to prevent inadequate personnel from entering the system in the first place. The legislation you will propose would require nursing homes to conduct criminal background checks on all potential personnel.	The proposed legislation to require nursing homes to conduct criminal background checks on potential personnel would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are privileged and would not be available to a party in litigation with the agency. However, the proposed legislation is not a memorandum or letter, nor does it involve any inter-agency or intra-agency communication. Therefore, FOIA exemption 5 would not apply in this case.; ; Case law: In National Labor Relations Board v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), the Supreme Court held that FOIA exemption 5 applies only to inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are privileged and would not be available to a party in litigation with the agency. The proposed legislation does not fall within this category and therefore would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

Once inadequate personnel have been identified, they should be kept out of the system. The new legislation will ask Congress to establish a national registry of nursing home employees convicted of abusing residents.	"It is possible that the National Abuse Registry could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This would depend on whether the creation and maintenance of the registry involved internal agency deliberations or communications that are considered privileged. ; ; However, there is no clear case law that directly addresses whether a national registry of nursing home employees would be exempt under FOIA exemption 5. Some relevant cases that may provide guidance include:; ; - NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975): This case established that exemption 5 covers inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda that are both predecisional (i.e. prepared before a final decision has been made) and deliberative (i.e. reflecting the agency's thought processes and decision-making). If the creation of the National Abuse Registry involved such memoranda or communications, they could be protected under this exemption.; ; - Dep't of the Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass'n (2001): This case clarified that exemption 5 does not cover purely factual information or final agency decisions. If the National Abuse Registry only contains factual information about convicted nursing home employees, it may not be protected under this exemption.; ; - Milner v. Dep't of the Navy (2011): This case held that exemption 5 does not cover records that are not ""predecisional"" or ""deliberative,"" even if they are ""inter-agency"" or ""intra-agency."" If the National Abuse Registry is simply a compilation of public records of convictions, it may not be protected under this exemption.; ; Overall, it is difficult to determine whether the National Abuse Registry would be exempt under FOIA exemption 5 without more information about its creation and contents. However, the case law suggests that the exemption would only apply if the registry contains privileged communications or deliberative materials, rather than purely factual information or final agency decisions."

Currently, too few nursing home staff are available to help feed residents. To improve nutrition in nursing homes, you will ask Congress to allow more categories of nursing home employees to perform crucial nutrition and hydration functions.	"The statement would likely not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. The statement provided does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. Rather, it appears to be a proposal or recommendation for a policy change. As such, it would not be protected under exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this statement, but courts have generally held that exemption 5 does not apply to documents that are not pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. For example, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, the court held that documents that were not pre-decisional or deliberative, but rather were ""final opinions, orders, statements of policy, and interpretations"" were not protected under exemption 5. Similarly, in Tax Analysts v. IRS, the court held that documents that were not pre-decisional or deliberative, but rather were ""factual or purely investigative"" were not protected under exemption 5."

Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ;                 • Reauthorization of the ursing Home Ombudsman Program. You also will call on Congress to reauthorize the nursing home ombudsman program run by the Administration on Aging, which provides consumers with critical information on poor-quality nursing homes, including records of abuse and neglect.	No, the reauthorization of the nursing home ombudsman program would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The reauthorization of the nursing home ombudsman program is a policy recommendation and not an inter-agency or intra-agency communication. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this issue. However, courts have consistently held that FOIA exemption 5 only applies to documents that are predecisional and deliberative in nature, and that the exemption does not apply to purely factual information or final agency actions. In this case, the reauthorization of the nursing home ombudsman program is a final agency action and not a predecisional or deliberative document. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; New Administrative Actions To Improve the Quality of Nursing Homes. You will announce new administrative actions that HCFA will implement immediately, including:	It is possible that the information regarding the new administrative actions to improve the quality of nursing homes could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This would depend on whether the information was part of a deliberative process, meaning it was part of the agency's decision-making process and not a final decision or policy.; ; If the information was part of a deliberative process, it could be protected under exemption 5 because it is considered pre-decisional and therefore not subject to disclosure. However, if the information was already a final decision or policy, it would not be protected under exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this issue, as it would depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case. However, courts have generally held that exemption 5 applies to materials that are part of a deliberative process and are pre-decisional in nature. For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 protected internal agency memoranda that were part of a deliberative process and contained opinions, recommendations, and advice regarding a proposed rulemaking.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ;     • Immediate Civil Monetary Penalties in Nursing Homes That Violate Federal Standards. To crack down on inadequate providers, HCFA will direct enforcement authorities to impose civil monetary penalties immediately upon finding a serious or chronic violation. Under current practice, enforcement officials often give nursing homes a second chance to come into compliance, rather than impose immediate sanctions.	"The information regarding the immediate imposition of civil monetary penalties in nursing homes that violate federal standards would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This is because the information pertains to the internal decision-making process of HCFA and its enforcement authorities in determining when and how to impose penalties on nursing homes. ; ; In the case of NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975), the Supreme Court established that exemption 5 covers ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" This includes documents that are ""predecisional"" and ""deliberative"" in nature, meaning they were created before a final decision was made and contain opinions, recommendations, or advice that were part of the decision-making process. ; ; In this case, the information about the immediate imposition of civil monetary penalties would likely be considered predecisional and deliberative because it pertains to the internal discussions and recommendations made by HCFA and its enforcement authorities before deciding to impose penalties on nursing homes. As such, it would likely be protected under exemption 5 and not subject to disclosure under FOIA."

Starting today, HCFA will take several steps to strengthen states' inspection of nursing homes, such as:	"The statement would likely not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. The statement in question appears to be a factual announcement of a policy change, rather than a communication that is part of the agency's decision-making process. Additionally, the statement does not appear to involve any confidential or privileged information that would warrant protection under exemption 5. ; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this statement, but courts have generally held that factual information and statements of policy are not protected under exemption 5. For example, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, the Supreme Court held that ""purely factual"" material is not protected under exemption 5, even if it is contained in an inter-agency or intra-agency communication. Similarly, in National Wildlife Federation v.

D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Staggering survey times: The report that HCFA is transmitting to Congress finds that nursing home inspeciions are too predictable, allowing inadequate homes to prepare for inspections. Enforcement officials will now stagger survey times and conduct some surveys on weekends and evenings.	"The information regarding the staggering of survey times would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This is because the information pertains to the internal decision-making process of the agency and the implementation of a new policy. The disclosure of this information could potentially harm the agency's ability to effectively carry out its duties and enforce regulations.; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 covers ""intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" The Court reasoned that disclosure of such information would ""inhibit frank discussion of legal or policy matters"" within the agency.; ; Similarly, in Schiller v. NLRB (1981), the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals held that exemption 5 applies to ""predecisional"" and ""deliberative"" materials that are ""generated before the adoption of an agency policy and reflect the give-and-take of the consultative process."" The court noted that disclosure of such materials could ""chill the deliberative process"" and ""undermine the quality of agency decisions."" ; ; Therefore, the information regarding the staggering of survey times would likely be protected under exemption 5, as it pertains to the agency's internal decision-making process and the implementation of a new policy."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Targeting chains with bad records: Federal and State officials will target nursing home chains that have a poor record of compliance with the Federal regulations for additional inspections.	"The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The reasoning is that the statement appears to be a policy decision or internal communication between federal and state officials regarding the targeting of nursing home chains with poor compliance records. This type of communication is typically considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 covers ""intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" The targeting of nursing home chains with poor compliance records appears to be an internal communication that would not be available to a party other than the agency, and therefore falls within the scope of exemption 5."

"The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be a communication between agencies (HCFA, HHS Office of Inspector General, and Department of Justice) regarding potential criminal investigations, which could be considered privileged information. ; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1978), in which the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 covers ""intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" In this case, the Court found that the exemption applied to communications between the National Labor Relations Board and its staff regarding potential litigation. Similarly, the communication between HCFA, HHS Office of Inspector General, and Department of Justice regarding potential criminal investigations would likely be considered privileged and protected under exemption 5."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ;     • Stronger Federal Oversight of State Inspections. HCFA will increase its oversight of state surveyors, review and monitor nursing homes with greater consistency, and take new tough actions against those states that are failing to adequately enforce standards. It will:	"The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This is because the statement appears to be a policy decision or internal communication within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), specifically the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), regarding their oversight of state inspections of nursing homes. As such, it could be considered a deliberative process privilege, which protects pre-decisional and deliberative communications that are part of the agency's decision-making process.; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that the deliberative process privilege protects ""documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated."" Another relevant case is Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854 (D.C. Cir. 1980), which held that the privilege applies to ""documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated."" ; ; Overall, the statement about increased oversight of state inspections appears to be an internal communication within HCFA that is part of the agency's decision-making process, and as such, it would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Terminate Federal nursing home inspection funding to states with continual poor records. The report being released by HCFA finds that some states have cited few or no nursing homes for substandard care. In states where oversight is clearly inadequate, HCFA will terminate state contracts and contract with other entities to conduct Federally-approved inspections.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The statement in question does not fall under this exemption as it is not a communication between agencies or within an agency. It is a policy statement regarding the termination of federal funding to states with poor records in nursing home inspections. ; ; Furthermore, FOIA exemption 5 does not protect information that is required to be disclosed by law. In this case, the policy statement is a matter of public interest and is required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act. ; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this statement, but the Supreme Court has held that FOIA exemptions must be narrowly construed and any doubts must be resolved in favor of disclosure.

The statement provided does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. Rather, it is a statement of a plan or action to be taken by HCFA. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this statement, but courts have generally held that exemption 5 does not apply to purely factual information or statements of policy or plans. For example, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, the court held that ""purely factual material"" is not protected under exemption 5, and in Public Citizen Health Research Group v.

Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Ensure that nursing homes are in compliance with standards before lifting sanctions. HCFA will increase oversight of state enforcement officials to ensure that they will not lift sanctions until after an on-site visit has verified compliance.	The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be a policy decision made by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) regarding oversight of state enforcement officials and the lifting of sanctions. As such, it may be considered a deliberative process privilege, which protects pre-decisional communications that are part of the agency's decision-making process. ; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that the deliberative process privilege protects communications that are part of the agency's decision-making process and that would reveal the agency's deliberations, thought processes, and recommendations. The statement in question appears to fall within this category, as it reflects the agency's decision-making process and its efforts to ensure compliance with standards before lifting sanctions.

To increase accountability and flag repeat offenders for families and the public, HCFA will, for the first time, post individual nursing home survey results on the Internet. /	The publishing of survey results on the internet would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The publishing of survey results on the internet does not fall under this exemption as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications. Additionally, the information being published is not privileged or confidential. ; ; Case law that supports this conclusion includes Milner v. Department of the Navy, 562 U.S. 562 (2011), where the Supreme Court held that FOIA exemption 5 only applies to documents that are both predecisional and deliberative.

In June 1998, HCFA began collecting information on resident care through a national automated data system, known as Minimum Data Sets. This information will be analyzed to identify potential areas of inadequate care in nursing homes and to assess performance in critical areas, such as nutrition, avoidable bed sores, loss of mobility, and use ofrestraints. This assessment will help HCFA and state surveyors to identify nursing homes for immediate on-site inspections and to detect and correct problems earlier.	The information provided would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The information provided does not fall under this exemption as it does not involve any inter-agency or intra-agency communication.

However, if the document is simply a schedule or list of press events or activities, it is less likely that the phrase would be protected.; ; Case law that may be relevant to this issue includes NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975), which established the ""deliberative process privilege"" under exemption 5. This privilege protects communications that are part of the decision-making process within an agency, and are therefore considered confidential and exempt from disclosure.

During the late 1980s, many states established financing schemes that had the effect of increasing their Federal Medicaid funds without using additional state resources. Typically, states would raise funds from health care providers (through provider taxes or ""donations""), then pay back those providers through increased Medicaid payments. Since the Federal government pays at least half of Medicaid payments, the provider taxes or donations would be repaid in large part by Federal matching payments. Using this mechanism, the state was left with a net gain because it only had to repay part of the provider tax or donation it originally received.  This led to an unprecedented drain on the Federal Treasury - the major reason why Federal Medicaid costs more than doubled between 1988 and 1992."

The information provided does not involve any privileged communications, but rather describes a financing scheme used by states to increase their Federal Medicaid funds. There is no indication that any agency is involved in the financing scheme or that any privileged communications are being disclosed. Therefore, exemption 5 would not apply in this case.; ; Case law supporting this conclusion includes Milner v. Department of the Navy, 562 U.S. 562 (2011), which held that exemption 5 only applies to privileged communications and does not cover information that is merely confidential or sensitive. Additionally, National Labor Relations Board v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), held that exemption 5 only applies to communications that are part of the agency decision-making process and are therefore privileged. Since the information provided does not involve agency decision-making or privileged communications, exemption 5 would not apply.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; The law and regulatory interpretation of the law. Because provider taxes and donations were effectively siphoning off potentially billions of dollars from the Federal Treasury, the Congress limited states' use of these schemes in a bill enacted by President Bush in 1991.  It is important to note that the subsequent regulatory interpretation of these limits -- the very regulations that we are now planning to enforce -- was negotiated with the states and the National Governors' Association in 1993.	"Yes, the statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those that are deliberative in nature.

D0			"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; States' continued reliance on impermissible provider taxes and our enforcement record. Despite the new law and the regulations, many states continued to use provider taxes that at least appeared to be out of compliance. To date, these possibly impermissible taxes total an estimated $2 to 4 billion and, in the future, will cost billions more. In response, HCFA issued letters and discussed its concerns about certain taxes with states, but -- for a variety of reasons -- never took any final action (called a ""disallowance""). Unfortunately, this has meant that a number of states have continued using these taxes, believing that HCFA might never enforce the law, or that if they did, they could seek recourse through the White House or the Congress. (In fact, since we do not have a good track record on enforcement, budget examiners at CBO and in the Administration have already written off Federal revenue raised through these provider taxes; this is important to know since it means we could waive past ""abuses"" retrospectively and it might not be scored as a cost.)"	"It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" This exemption is often used to protect pre-decisional and deliberative communications within an agency.; ; In this case, the information pertains to HCFA's enforcement record and its interactions with states regarding potentially impermissible provider taxes. The mention of letters and discussions with states suggests that there may be internal communications within HCFA that could be protected under exemption 5.; ; However, it is important to note that exemption 5 is not an absolute protection and must be balanced against the public interest in disclosure. In this case, there may be a strong public interest in understanding how HCFA is enforcing the law and addressing potentially non-compliant provider taxes. Additionally, the mention of budget examiners writing off federal revenue raises questions about the potential impact on taxpayers and the government's ability to collect revenue.; ; Overall, whether or not this information is protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific content of the communications and the balancing of the public interest in disclosure. There does not appear to be any specific case law directly on point for this particular issue."
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; The New York provision in the balanced budget. To ensure that New York would never be vulnerable to Medicaid provider tax enforcement actions, Senator Moynihan and Senator D' Amato successfully added a provision to the Balanced Budget Act to exempt all of its provider taxes (it has dozens), both retrospectively and prospectively, from disallowances. Both in writing and orally we repeatedly objected to this provision. Moreover, we provided alternative statutory language that would have addressed about two-thirds (over $ I billion worth) of the problem. As you know, however, the Senators (through their staff) rejected our offer and insisted on their original provisions.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The passage describes communications between Senators and their staff regarding the inclusion of a provision in a federal law, which could be considered privileged legislative communications.

In announcing the line-item veto on August 11, we raised concerns about the cost and ramifications of singling out as permissible one state's provider taxes. Although our actions were generally viewed as responsible and defensible by those who know the program and/or who are budget experts, the same clearly cannot be said of New York's political establishment. The Governor's office, the New York Congressional delegation, the Mayor, providers and unions reacted strongly and negatively to the veto.  Among a host of complaints, they charged that they were singled out and were never made aware that this provision could be subject to the line item veto. Most recently they have criticized us for our . delay in getting back to them and our willingness to support fixes for the other two vetoed provisions without addressing their problem.

In August, we began a review of the options to address provider taxes in New York and other states. At the time, we well knew that this action would force us to finally attempt to move to enforce laws against provider taxes in all 36 states that may be out of compliance. We also knew that we had to take this position to support our justification for the line-item veto that no individual state be singled out for special treatment.

We believe that our discussion with New York next Wednesday about their provider tax status necessitates that we concurrently release similar information to every other potentially affected state. Three types of actions resulting from this comprehensive review will be announced. First, HCFA will clarify its interpretation of the law and correct the regulation affecting one of the largest New York provider taxes. These policy  clarifications will provide relief to JO states, the largest amount (over $1 billion) going to New York. •	"The language provided would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

Two more states, New York and Louisiana, will also receive this news, but it will be in a letter that also provides some good news about other provider taxes in their states. HCFA will immediately contact these states to begin discussions. The letters do not contain final decisions nor are they legally binding; however, they tell these states that, without further information, HCFA could conduct an audit.

(Nine other states who are in one of the top two categories will get similar requests.) For these states, we simply do not have sufficient information to determine the legality of at least some of their taxes.  As we discuss this issue with these states, however, we will also make certain they are aware that they may be eligible for waivers that make their taxes permissible and/or that the provision of additional information may well clarify the legality of their taxes.

The follow up to these letters will be, we hope, immediate discussions between HCFA and the states. Our primary goal is to protect the Federal Treasury prospectively.

Very few of the states who receive notices will be pleased. For example, although HCFA is relieving approximately two-thirds of New York's past impermissible tax claims (worth over $1 billion), there is still at least $500 million in taxes that HCFA probably cannot consider legal. The New York delegation has already put us on notice that nothing less than a ""hold harmless"" solution is acceptable.

Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.

He calls for greater coordination among Customs, the Border Patrol and other relevant agencies to address the flow of drugs and urges you designate a single federal official responsible for all counterdrug efforts along the border.

Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT FROM BARRY McCAFFREY SUBJECT: Organizing Drug Control Efforts along the Southwest Border	"The memorandum for the President from Barry McCaffrey regarding organizing drug control efforts along the Southwest border would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The memorandum is an intra-agency communication between Barry McCaffrey and the President, and it is likely that the information contained in the memorandum would not be available to a party other than the agency in litigation with the agency.; ; Case law that supports this conclusion includes NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), which held that exemption 5 protects documents that are ""predecisional"" and ""deliberative."" The memorandum from McCaffrey to the President is likely predecisional and deliberative because it is a communication between two high-level officials discussing policy options and recommendations. Additionally, in United States v. Weber Aircraft Corp., 465 U.S. 792 (1984), the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 protects documents that are ""part of the agency's deliberative process."" The memorandum from McCaffrey to the President is likely part of the agency's deliberative process because it contains recommendations and options for organizing drug control efforts along the Southwest border. Therefore, the memorandum would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5."

The purpose of this memorandum is to update you on ONDCP's views of the challenges facing our drug-control efforts along the Southwest Border and our ideas for improving coordination among the twenty-three federal agencies involved in drug-control operations there. The enclosed White Paper and Concept for Analysis outline the general problem and offer specific suggestions for consideration by your Drug Policy Council. We intend to present a coordinated set of recommendations for your consideration this fall.	"The above statement may be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The memorandum appears to be an internal communication between the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and the Drug Policy Council, discussing sensitive information related to drug-control efforts along the Southwest Border. The mention of a ""White Paper and Concept for Analysis"" suggests that the memorandum may contain deliberative process material, which is also covered under exemption 5.; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 covers ""documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated."" Another relevant case is Coastal States Gas Corp. v. DOE (1981), in which the Court held that exemption 5 covers ""predecisional communications which reflect the give-and-take of the consultative process.""; ; Overall, the memorandum appears to be a privileged communication that may be protected under FOIA exemption 5."

The drug-control challenges we face along the Southwest Border, though severe, are not insurmountable. About 60 percent of the cocaine entering the U.S. does so across this border, yet seizures in the border region are declining. Total 1998 cocaine seizures are projected to be less than half of the annual average seized between 1991 and 1996 and account for just a fifth of the cocaine crossing the border. Heroin seizures have declined by about a third since 1996. Over the past several years, the general trend has been one of fewer seizures of all drugs except marijuana. Our visits last month to San Diego and El Paso reinforced our belief that immediate action must be taken to address the following issues:	This statement would likely not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not appear to contain privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of government decision-making. Rather, it appears to be a factual statement about drug-control challenges along the Southwest Border and the need for action to address those challenges. There is no case law cited as this is a straightforward application of the exemption.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ;     • Drug smugglers coordinate their efforts. Anecdotal evidence and seizure data in El Paso reveals that when met with resistance smugglers simply shift their methods and routes at the ports of entry (POEs) and between the POEs.	The statement about drug smugglers coordinating their efforts and shifting their methods and routes at ports of entry and between them would likely not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. However, the statement in question does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it involve privileged or confidential information. Rather, it is a general observation based on anecdotal evidence and seizure data. Therefore, it is unlikely to be protected under exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this scenario, but courts have generally interpreted exemption 5 narrowly and have required agencies to demonstrate that the information at issue falls within the scope of the exemption. For example, in Milner v. Department of the Navy (2011), the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 did not protect maps and data that were used to assess the environmental impact of a proposed naval facility, because they were not part of a deliberative process and were not predecisional. Similarly, in Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice (2016), the D.C. Circuit held that exemption 5 did not protect a PowerPoint presentation that was created by an agency but shared with a non-governmental organization, because it was not an intra-agency communication. These cases suggest that the statement about drug smugglers would not be protected under exemption 5, because it does not involve privileged or confidential information and is not part of a deliberative process or intra-agency communication.

The statement provided would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The statement provided does not fall under this category as it is not a memorandum or letter. Additionally, the statement does not contain any privileged or confidential information that would warrant protection under exemption 5. ; ; There is no case law that specifically addresses this statement, but courts have consistently held that exemption 5 only applies to documents that are predecisional and deliberative in nature.

If a Border Patrol officer needs immediate assistance from a member of US Customs, he would have to radio his communications center which would then contact US Customs communications by telephone. US Customs communications would then radio their personnel to assist the Border Patrol officer. This time consuming process puts agents at risk.	"No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials.

Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this statement. However, courts have consistently held that FOIA exemption 5 applies only to privileged or confidential inter-agency or intra-agency communications or materials. For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 applies only to materials that are ""predecisional"" and ""deliberative"" in nature, and that the exemption does not protect purely factual information or final agency decisions. Similarly, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854 (D.C. Cir. 1980), the D.C. Circuit held that exemption 5 applies only to materials that are ""intra-agency or inter-agency in character"" and that the exemption does not protect information that is ""generated outside the agency and merely received or incorporated by the agency."" Based on these principles, the statement provided would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5."

The enclosed ONDCP White Paper contains specific recommendations to attain the following objectives:	It is possible that the enclosed ONDCP White Paper could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This exemption includes materials that are considered deliberative or pre-decisional, meaning they were created before a final decision was made and contain opinions, recommendations, or advice. ; ; In this case, the language used suggests that the White Paper contains specific recommendations for achieving certain objectives, which could be seen as pre-decisional. However, it would ultimately depend on the content of the White Paper and whether it was created as part of an agency's decision-making process. ; ; One case that could be relevant is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that documents containing opinions, recommendations, and advice that were part of an agency's decision-making process were protected under exemption 5. However, the Court also noted that the exemption did not apply to purely factual information or final agency decisions. ; ; Therefore, without more information about the content and context of the ONDCP White Paper, it is difficult to definitively determine whether it would be protected under exemption 5.

FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided does not fall under this category as it is a general statement about trends and does not involve any privileged or confidential communication between agencies. There is no case law that supports the application of exemption 5 to this type of statement.

Operational units must be able to communicate with higher headquarters, with other units and with sources of information. Too many of our systems are either operating in isolation or are dependent upon jerry-rigged solutions.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. The statement provided does not fall under this category as it does not involve any deliberative process or decision-making. It is a factual statement about the state of communication systems within operational units. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law that supports this conclusion as it is a general interpretation of FOIA exemption 5. However, the Supreme Court case NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975) established that the exemption applies to materials that are both pre-decisional and deliberative in nature.

Separate agencies collecting intelligence often do not share information that may be relevant for another agency. At the same time, agencies are sometimes unable to internally disseminate intelligence within their own organization in time to stop a shipment. Information must be made available to all involved law enforcement agencies in time to stop shipments of drugs.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided does not fall under either of these categories and is instead discussing the need for timely intelligence sharing between agencies to stop drug shipments. ; ; There is no specific case law that directly applies to this statement, but it is clear that it does not meet the criteria for exemption 5 protection.

Lack of efficient non-intrusive inspection technology to screen cross-border traffic and detect drugs. Currently there are only three truck scanners in place along the border. Traffickers quickly adjust to the construction of such devices, and shift drugs elsewhere. We must develop, test and field technology that can detect drugs while not hindering legitimate commerce.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided does not fall under either of these categories and is instead a statement of fact and policy. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law that applies to this statement, as it is not a communication between agencies or within an agency. However, FOIA exemption 5 has been interpreted by courts to apply only to privileged or confidential communications, and not to statements of fact or policy. For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), the Supreme Court held that FOIA exemption 5 did not apply to a report prepared by an agency that contained factual information and recommendations, as opposed to deliberative process materials.

Our efforts  to date have  not yielded  the benefits we had hoped for with the exception of marijuana, though early 1998 seizure data are showing improvements:	"It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and deliberative process privilege. The statement appears to be discussing the effectiveness of a government program, which could be considered part of the agency's deliberative process. However, without more context it is difficult to determine whether this information would meet the requirements for exemption 5 protection.; ; One case that may be relevant is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that the deliberative process privilege protects ""documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated."" However, the Court also noted that the privilege is not absolute and must be balanced against the public interest in disclosure. Therefore, even if this information is protected under exemption 5, a requester could argue that the public interest in knowing about the effectiveness of government programs outweighs the agency's interest in keeping this information confidential."

No, the statement about methamphetamine seizures would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process, and that would not be available to the public if they were requested through FOIA. The statement about methamphetamine seizures is a factual statement and does not involve any inter-agency or intra-agency communication. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.; ; There is no case law that specifically addresses this issue, as it is a straightforward application of the exemption 5 criteria. However, case law such as NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975) and EPA v.

Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854 (D.C. Cir. 1980). In that case, the court held that the deliberative process privilege applies to documents that are ""predecisional and deliberative in nature"" and that ""reflect the give-and-take of the consultative process."" The court also noted that the privilege is intended to protect the quality of agency decision-making by allowing officials to freely exchange ideas without fear of public disclosure. ; ; In this case, the statement about cocaine trafficking appears to be part of a confidential assessment of border security measures, which would likely be considered predecisional and deliberative in nature.

For the last three years, the many federal agencies involved in law enforcement, commerce and transportation along our border have been engaged in a process to determine how we can best fulfill these anti-drug imperatives. The Attorney General and the Secretaries of State, Treasury, Commerce, Defense, and Transportation, and the leadership of the DEA, the Border Patrol, Customs, and the INS have been integral to this effort.  Our common  response is to create a Southwest Border Counter-Drug White Paper for approval by the President during the fall of 1998.	The language in this passage does not appear to fall under FOIA exemption 5, which protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. This passage describes a process that has already taken place and a response that has been agreed upon by multiple agencies and leaders. It does not appear to contain any deliberative or pre-decisional information that would be protected under exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law cited to support this conclusion, as the language in this passage is straightforward and does not appear to raise any significant legal issues related to FOIA exemption 5.
D0			Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ;     A. The Southwest Border counter-drug principles. Three core U.S. principles guide all our efforts:	No, the Southwest Border counter-drug principles would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The Southwest Border counter-drug principles do not fall under this category as they are not inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters. Additionally, the principles are not likely to contain pre-decisional or deliberative information that would qualify for exemption 5 protection. Therefore, the Southwest Border counter-drug principles would be subject to disclosure under FOIA. ; ; There is no specific case law that addresses the exemption of the Southwest Border counter-drug principles under FOIA exemption 5. However, case law such as NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975) and United States v. Weber Aircraft Corp. (1973) have established the criteria for determining whether a document is protected under exemption 5. These criteria include whether the document is inter-agency or intra-agency, whether it contains pre-decisional or deliberative information, and whether disclosure would harm the decision-making process. Based on these criteria, it is unlikely that the Southwest Border counter-drug principles would be protected under exemption 5.

There are six counter-drug objectives to be achieved:	"It is possible that the Southwest Border counter-drug objectives could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, this would depend on whether the objectives were developed through a process that involved the exchange of confidential or deliberative information between government officials.; ; If the objectives were simply a list of publicly available goals, they would not be protected under exemption 5. However, if they were the result of internal discussions or analysis, or if they contained sensitive information about ongoing operations, they could be considered privileged.; ; One case that supports this interpretation is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that exemption 5 covers ""documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated."" Similarly, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. DOE (1981), the Court held that exemption 5 applies to ""predecisional"" documents that are ""deliberative in nature"" and ""reflect the give-and-take of the consultative process.""; ; Therefore, whether the Southwest Border counter-drug objectives are protected under exemption 5 would depend on the specific circumstances of their development and the nature of the information they contain."

The statement appears to be a policy recommendation or strategy, which could be considered part of the agency's deliberative process. However, without additional context or information about the origin and purpose of the statement, it is difficult to make a definitive determination.; ; One case that may be relevant is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1978), in which the Supreme Court established the ""deliberative process privilege"" as a subset of exemption 5. The Court held that the privilege protects ""documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated."" However, the Court also noted that the privilege is not absolute and must be balanced against the public interest in disclosure.; ; In this case, the public interest in disclosure may be high, given the importance of border security and drug control. However, if the statement was part of an internal discussion or analysis of potential strategies, it may be considered protected under the deliberative process privilege.

It is possible that the information about the federal officer responsible for counter-drug efforts along the border could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, deliberative process privilege, and attorney work product. ; ; If the information about the officer's responsibilities and actions were part of internal agency deliberations or attorney-client communications, it could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, if the information is purely factual and not part of any privileged communication, it would not be protected under exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law that directly addresses this scenario, but courts have generally interpreted exemption 5 narrowly and require agencies to demonstrate that the information is actually privileged and would harm the agency's decision-making process if disclosed. Therefore, the agency would need to provide a detailed explanation of why the information about the federal officer is privileged and how its disclosure would harm the agency's operations.

"The information regarding the authority to review and integrate Southwest Border drug policy, procedures, budget and resource levels, construction and control of infrastructure, and intelligence would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This information likely falls under the deliberative process privilege, which protects pre-decisional and deliberative communications that are part of the decision-making process. ; ; In the case of NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., the Supreme Court held that the deliberative process privilege protects documents that are both pre-decisional and deliberative in nature, meaning they are part of the agency's decision-making process and contain opinions, recommendations, or advice. The information regarding Southwest Border drug policy, procedures, budget and resource levels, construction and control of infrastructure, and intelligence likely contains such opinions, recommendations, or advice, and would therefore be protected under exemption 5. ; ; Additionally, in the case of Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, the Supreme Court held that the deliberative process privilege also protects documents that are ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" This means that even if the information were not protected under the deliberative process privilege, it could still be protected under exemption 5 if it is an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letter that would not be available to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. ; ; Therefore, the information regarding the authority to review and integrate Southwest Border drug policy, procedures, budget and resource levels, construction and control of infrastructure, and intelligence would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5."

"The authority to request redeployment of counter-drug interdiction resources from federal officials would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This is because the authority to request such redeployment likely involves internal deliberations and decision-making processes within the agency, which are typically protected from disclosure under this exemption.; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v.

Summary Inadequate dredging of the channels and berthing  areas serving  the Port of  New  York  and New Jersey, and the lack of leadership to solve the problem, have caused several major port companies to announce that they may  relocate their hub operations to Halifax,  Nova Scotia, or to other U.S. ports. Company decisions are expected in June or July. Fearful of job losses to Canada, the longshoremen have focused pressure to resolve dredging  issues on  Governors Pataki and Whitman. Concurrently, concern about disposal of contaminated dredged  material off New Jersey's coast has prompted Governor Whitman to criticize the  Administration's disposal policies as environmentally unsound. Her message has been lauded and reinforced by environmental groups and New Jersey shore communities, but it has further impeded needed dredging.	The above statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. However, the statement above does not involve any such communication.

It also discusses the pressure on Governors Pataki and Whitman to resolve dredging issues and the concern about disposal of contaminated dredged material off New Jersey's coast.

Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; The primary obstacle to full-scale dredging is the lack of acceptable disposal alternatives. Disposal alternatives are primarily a state responsibility, but  require federal  action. On  May 24, in an agreement with labor leaders, Governor Whitman promised that limited dredging of berthing areas would begin in June. We understand  that Governor  Whitman  is planning  a press conference on June 6 to announce the start of dredging, but port companies and unions remain highly skeptical. A visible, credible signal is therefore still needed to persuade the unions, port companies, and state governments that the  Administration  is  ready  to  get dredging moving as soon  as the states do their  part. We also  must  disarm  possible criticism on the environmental issues. Thus, the initiative  proposed  here is in  large  measure preemptive: we are increasing pressure on Whitman and Pataki to make tough decisions about local disposal options while protecting the President from  blame  either  for  imminent  job losses or for potential harm to the oceans. At  the same  time,  we  must  take care  not  to suggest too much Federal ""ownership"" of a problem that  inherently  must stay  on  the governors' doorsteps. The governors, not the Administration, must resolve politically divisive decisions about local disposal sites, and must negotiate between  themselves  the  relative benefits New York and New Jersey receive from Port Authority monies earmarked for dredging."

Federal law and policy now allows  disposal  of  category  I  and category 2 dredge material  at  this site.  (Category  I  is clean;  category  2 passes  tests but has some contamination; category 3 is not suitable for disposal in the ocean.) Governor Whitman has pledged not  to  put category  2 in  the  ocean,  and  that  pledge has been strongly endorsed by environmental groups and  shore  newspapers,  but there  are very few alternatives for category 2 disposal in the short  term.  Our  initiative proposed a decision by January 31, 1997 concerning the phase out of the Mud Dump Site, with the consideration of the alternatives for disposal.	"The information regarding the Mud Dump Site and the proposed decision to phase it out with consideration of alternatives for disposal would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" (5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5)). This exemption is often used to protect deliberative process privilege, which shields from disclosure documents that are predecisional and deliberative in nature. However, in this case, the information does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters, and it does not appear to be predecisional or deliberative in nature. Rather, it is a description of a disposal site and a proposed decision to phase it out with consideration of alternatives. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.

This is a proposed rule revising  the regulations  governing how and when to test for contamination  in dredge material.    A New Jersey federal court opinion argues that EPA's technical manuals conflict with its underlying regulation -- rendering permits legally vulnerable. Environmentalists have derided EPA's rule as a ""rollback""  of ocean protection. Unions and port operators want the rule finalized as soon as possible, believing the rule change essential if permits to dispose material at the MDS are to survive court challenges. Our initiative proposed EPA action on the rule by August 1, I 996."	The EPA testing rule would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. However, the EPA testing rule is a proposed rule that has not yet been finalized or adopted by the agency. As such, it is not a pre-decisional or deliberative communication, but rather a proposed action that is subject to public comment and review. Therefore, FOIA exemption 5 would not apply to the EPA testing rule.; ; Case law that supports this conclusion includes Public Citizen Health Research Group v. FDA, 704 F.2d 1280 (D.C.

This type of internal discussion is often considered privileged because it allows agencies to freely explore different ideas and options without fear of public scrutiny or criticism. As such, courts have generally upheld the use of exemption 5 to protect pre-decisional deliberations from disclosure.; ; In addition, the statement could also be seen as reflecting attorney-client communications, as it suggests that the agency is seeking legal advice or guidance on how to proceed with the rule. This type of communication is also generally considered privileged under exemption 5, as it allows agencies to seek confidential legal advice without fear of disclosure.; ; Overall, while there is no specific case law that directly addresses this particular statement, courts have generally been willing to apply exemption 5 to protect pre-decisional deliberations and attorney-client communications in similar contexts.

We would expect  that this will  disarm  environmental  criticism  and help move short-term dredging, but we would  want  to  elicit  an  understanding  with  New York and New Jersey that they will not be criticize short-term use of the MDS.	This statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. However, this statement does not appear to be a communication between government agencies or officials, nor does it appear to be pre-decisional or deliberative in nature.

The passage discusses the need to work closely with Representative Menendez and his staff to persuade them to delay a rule and enlist their help in persuading others to do the same. This involves sensitive political and legal considerations, which may be protected by the deliberative process privilege. The passage also suggests that these discussions will be confidential, which may indicate that they are attorney-client communications. ; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), which established the deliberative process privilege as a valid exemption under FOIA. The court held that the privilege protects ""documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated."" The passage in question appears to reflect such deliberations and may therefore be protected under exemption 5."
