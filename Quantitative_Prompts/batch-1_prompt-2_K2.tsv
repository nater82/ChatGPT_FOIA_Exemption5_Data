However, without additional context or information about the content of the email, it is difficult to determine whether it meets the criteria for exemption 5.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; That list sounds fine to me. From #2, I would only highlight a & b -- I wouldn't do the others or make much of them. On #3, I would announce both now, I think.	It is difficult to determine whether the statement would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 without additional context. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or contain deliberative process material. The statement provided does not clearly indicate whether it is an inter-agency or intra-agency communication, nor does it indicate whether it contains privileged or deliberative process material. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether it would be protected under exemption 5 without additional information.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Rahm wants to leak the school violence report for Monday a.m. I don't think we're going to get much pressure for announcements.	It is unlikely that this statement would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. This statement does not appear to be a communication between government agencies or officials, nor does it involve any decision-making or deliberation. Rather, it appears to be a personal opinion or observation about the potential impact of leaking a report. Therefore, it is unlikely that this statement would be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
T0	T0	T0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Jonathan H. Schnur @ OVP	As an AI language model, I do not have access to the specific context of this statement. However, in general, FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature, such as opinions, recommendations, and advice exchanged between government officials. If Jonathan H. Schnur's communication falls under this category, it may be protected under FOIA exemption 5. However, if the communication contains factual information or is not related to the decision-making process, it may not be protected under this exemption. Ultimately, the determination of whether a specific communication is protected under FOIA exemption 5 would depend on the specific context and content of the communication.

T0	T0	T0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Bruce and Elena –	As an AI language model, I do not have access to the context of the information provided. However, FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. Therefore, whether Bruce and Elena would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 would depend on whether the information pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or protected by law.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Mike and I discussed a set of possible announcements and challenges that the President could make at Monday's TIMSS event. Mike asked me to run them by you. Could you please take a particularly close look at # 2, the challenges?	Yes, this communication would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of discussing possible announcements and challenges for the President at an event suggests that this communication is part of the agency's decision-making process and therefore falls under the deliberative process privilege. Additionally, the request to take a close look at a specific challenge further supports the idea that this communication is part of the agency's internal decision-making process.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The President could:	"No, the statement ""The President could"" would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. However, the statement ""The President could"" is not a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor is it pre-decisional or deliberative. It is a hypothetical statement that does not involve any agency action or decision-making process. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5."
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 1) Highlight the importance of moving forward on his education agenda, focusing heavily on the voluntary national 8th grade test but also mentioning class size, modern schools/school construction, urban education zones, High Hopes, teacher recruitment and training initiatives, and the $60 million middle school math initiative in the '99 budget.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. If this information was part of internal deliberations or discussions within the government about education policy, it could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, if this information was already publicly available or was not part of privileged communications, it would not be protected under exemption 5.

Explain your reasoning.; ; THE WHITE HOUSE WASHINGTON March 14, 1998 PRESIDENTIAL MEETING ON MATH AND SCIENCE EDUCATION DATE: March 15, 1998 LOCATION: Springbrook High School BRIEFING TIME: 9:30 am - 10:00 am EVENT TIME: 10:30 am - 11:50 am (meeting) 12:00 pm - 12:45 pm (remarks to students) FROM: Bruce Reed/Mike Cohen	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The fact that this is a briefing for a presidential meeting suggests that it contains internal communications between White House staff, which would likely be considered privileged. Additionally, the fact that it includes details about the president's schedule and location could be considered sensitive information that could potentially compromise security if released.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; I. PURPOSE  To bring together leaders from government, business, education, and the scientific community to discuss the recent 12th grade Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) results, and to issue a set of challenges to the nation to improve student achievement. You will also announce new on-line math and science help for parents, teachers, and students.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. The purpose statement provided does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; II. BACKGROUND You will be meeting with 25 leaders from government, business, education, and the scientific community to discuss how the nation should respond to recent findings from the Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) that while U.S. 4th graders are near the first in the world in science and above average in math, U.S. 12th graders lag below the international average in both subjects.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The meeting described in the background could be considered a privileged communication between government officials and leaders from other sectors, and the discussion of how to respond to the TIMSS findings could be seen as part of the government's decision-making process. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances and whether any exemptions or exceptions apply.
D0	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; These results demonstrate the importance of implementing your education agenda, including proposals for: national standards and tests in math and reading, smaller classes with well-prepared teachers, modem school buildings, Education Opportunity Zones to end social promotions and fix failing schools, technologically advanced schools, and ""High Hopes"" mentoring to encourage students to take tough classes and prepare for college."	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided appears to be a public statement regarding education policy proposals, rather than a privileged communication.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; In addition to reiterating your legislative proposals, you will issue the following new challenges to boost student achievement in math and science.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and contain opinions, recommendations, or advice. The statement provided does not contain any such communication and is simply a statement of proposed actions.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; • Reducing out-of-field teaching. You will challenge states and school districts to reduce the percentage of math and science teachers without a major or minor in their subject area. The average K-8th grade math teacher takes only three undergraduate math courses. Twenty-eight percent of secondary math teachers lack a major or minor in their subject area, as do 18% of secondary science teachers and 55% of physics teachers.	No, the statement about reducing out-of-field teaching would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement about reducing out-of-field teaching is a policy statement and does not involve any inter-agency or intra-agency communication. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; • Rigorous Tests for New Teachers. You will challenge states to require all new teachers of math and science to pass challenging tests of math or science knowledge and teaching proficiency. With nearly half of our nation's teaching force to be replaced over the next several years in order to accommodate growing student enrollments and an aging teaching force, raising standards of teaching now can boost the quality of our schools for decades.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement about rigorous tests for new teachers is a policy proposal and not a communication between agencies or within an agency. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; • A Call to Action for Schools, Students, and Parents. You will challenge schools to offer -- and students to take -- tough math and science courses throughout middle school and high school. Only 25% of U.S. students take algebra before high school, and only 25% of U.S. high school students take physics before graduating. You will challenge parents to insist that school districts provide ways of showing how children are doing compared to national standards and international benchmarks. Today, parents have no way of finding out how their children do compared to the international standards in TIMSS.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The passage provided does not appear to be a communication between government agencies or within a government agency, nor does it contain privileged or confidential information.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; You will also announce the following new on-line resources for parents, students, and teachers:	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement about announcing new online resources for parents, students, and teachers does not fall under this category and would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D0	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; • ""Federal Resources for Educational Excellence"" (FREE) Web-site. A new website is available today to connect teachers, parents, and students to teaching and learning resources in math, science, and other subject areas from NASA, the Energy Department, the National Science Foundation, and other agencies."	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information about the FREE website is not a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it contain privileged or confidential information. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; • The TIMSS On-Line Challenge. The U.S. Department of Education will launch this fall a website that puts TIMSS math and science problems on-line. This will enable parents to give a quiz to their children, learn what their children should know in math and science, and learn how their children are doing compared to students from other countries.	It is possible that the TIMSS On-Line Challenge could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This would depend on whether the information contained in the website was considered privileged or confidential, such as internal agency deliberations or attorney-client communications. However, if the information is simply educational materials intended for public use, it would not likely be protected under exemption 5.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Summary of the TIMSS Results: TIMSS showed that U.S. 12th graders scored among the lowest of2I nations in general math and science, with the U.S. outperforming only Cyprus and South Africa. Performance of U.S. 12th graders in advanced math and physics courses also lagged behind their peers from other nations. The 12th grade findings completed a multi-year study showing U.S. 4th graders near the first in the world in science and above average in math, with U.S. 8th graders slightly above the international average in science and below the international average in math. The 21 nations participating in the 12th grade study were the U.S., Canada, Australia, and many European nations. No Asian countries participated in the 12 grade tests. (See attachment of how the U.S. ranks compared to each participating country for all three grades.)	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege, the deliberative process privilege, and the presidential communications privilege. ; ; The information in this summary appears to be a report or analysis of data collected by a government agency, and it is possible that the agency could argue that the report is protected by the deliberative process privilege. This privilege protects communications that are part of the decision-making process within an agency, and are therefore considered pre-decisional and deliberative. ; ; However, it is also possible that the agency could argue that the information is not protected by exemption 5, as it is a summary of data that has already been released publicly. The fact that the information has been summarized and presented in a particular way may not be enough to qualify it as a privileged communication. ; ; Ultimately, whether or not this information is protected by exemption 5 would depend on the specific circumstances of its creation and dissemination, and would require a more detailed analysis of the agency's decision-making process and the role of this information within it.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; While there is not yet an analysis of the 12th grade TIMSS, an analysis was done of the 8th and 4th grade TIMSS. The analysis found that U.S. curriculum was less advanced, and that it covered more subjects superficially rather than a few subjects in depth. The analysis also showed that U.S. teachers often do not get as much training as those in other nations.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the analysis was conducted by a government agency or contractor and the information was considered privileged or confidential, it could be withheld under this exemption. However, if the analysis was conducted by an independent organization or individual and the information was not considered privileged or confidential, it would not be protected under exemption 5 and would be subject to release under FOIA.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Although other tests (including the National Assessment of Educational Progress) show that U.S. student achievement is improving, TIMSS makes clear these improvements are not rapid enough to keep pace with other nations in an increasingly global economy. Springbrook High School	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. However, the statement provided is a factual statement about student achievement and does not involve any privileged or confidential communication. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Springbrook High School is a good school with above-average test scores. Although the school has a solid math and science program, it is not particularly stronger than any of the other academic areas taught in the school. Springbrook has a very diverse student body (35% African American, 20% Asian, 16% Hispanic, 28% white), and it enrolls a total of 2,200 students.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials.

These communications could include confidential discussions about the bill's purpose, potential impacts, and legal implications, as well as any legal advice or analysis provided by attorneys working on the bill.; ; However, it is important to note that FOIA exemption 5 is not an absolute protection, and courts have often required agencies to provide a detailed justification for withholding information under this exemption. In addition, some types of information, such as factual data or final agency decisions, may not be protected under exemption 5 even if they are part of privileged communications.; ; Therefore, whether or not H.R. 2746 would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 would depend on the specific contents of the bill and the nature of the communications involved in its drafting and negotiation.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The Administration strongly opposes H R. 2746. If the bill were presented to the President, his senior advisers would recommend that the bill be vetoed. Under H.R. 2746, States and local school districts could provide vouchers for basic instruction in private schools, using funds that are otherwise available for the supplemental costs of education reform under Title VI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Federal funding of private school vouchers is bad policy because it would divert needed attention and resources from the Nation's public schools, which serve approximately 90 percent of students in kindergarten through twelfth grade.	The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. The statement appears to be a communication between senior advisers to the President regarding a potential veto of a bill, which would likely be considered privileged. Additionally, the statement contains policy recommendations and analysis, which could also be considered privileged.

Explain your reasoning.; ; The problematic rule and these two bills are now expected to come up on the House floor tomorrow (Thursday); Andy Blocker has confirmed that Democratic leadership will be opposing the rule; the question is whether any moderate Republicans who support charter schools and don't want to mess up the Riggs-Roemer bill will vote against it as well. Jon Schnur is letting John Doerr's folks know about this, because they have a strong interest in charter schools, and is also getting the word out to some in the charter schools community, who probably wouldn't want to see the bill fouled up.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This passage appears to be discussing political strategy and lobbying efforts, rather than internal agency deliberations.

CLINTON STATEMENT ON SCHOOL VOUCHER VOTE SEPTEMBER 30, 1997	It is possible that the statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation and dissemination of the statement. If the statement was created as part of an internal deliberative process within the White House or another agency, and if it contains candid advice or recommendations that were intended to be kept confidential, then it could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5. On the other hand, if the statement was intended for public release and was not part of any internal deliberations, then it would likely not be protected under exemption 5.

And I am pleased that 43 Democratic Senators have announced their intention to support high national standards and sustain my veto. Third, in a vote to occur today, some in Congress would diminish our country's commitment to public education by siphoning badly-needed funds away from our public schools into a voucher program that would support private education for a limited number of students. Ninety percent of America's children attend public schools. Our public schools are already facing a host of challenges with very limited funds. And we must continue to support proven reform efforts -- making schools safer, getting parents more involved, raising standards and improving teaching.	This statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not contain any privileged or confidential information related to the deliberative process of government decision-making. It is a public statement made by the President regarding his stance on legislation and policy issues, and therefore falls outside the scope of exemption 5.

Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. However, the statement does not appear to be a communication between government agencies or officials, nor does it contain any privileged or confidential information. It is simply a comment on a voucher amendment and the confusion surrounding it. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.

It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing internal agency strategy and decision-making, and could potentially be considered a privileged communication between agency officials. However, the specific context and circumstances surrounding the statement would need to be further evaluated to determine whether it meets the criteria for exemption 5 protection.

Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. If the ""Education amendment"" refers to a specific document or communication that falls under one of these categories, it may be protected under exemption 5. However, if it is a general topic or proposal that does not involve privileged communications, it would not be protected under exemption 5."
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The education amendment adopted in the Senate by a vote of 51-49 (Domenici voting for) was intended to allow the Labor Committee to fund school vouchers for children who are the victims of crime. It is basically not implementable although it does change budget resolution numbers. The amendment came in the form of a second degree to the Wellstone amendment (the Republicans wanted to avoid an up or down vote on Well stone).	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The information in this passage appears to be internal deliberations and discussions within the Senate about a proposed amendment, which would likely be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5. Additionally, the passage contains references to political maneuvering and strategy, which could also be considered privileged communications.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The text of the amendment states the intent as described above, and simply strikes Wellstone number changes and inserts an additional (not offset) $2.5 billion in 2000 in budget authority for Function 400, it also adds an additional $2.5 billion in budget aggregates. Outlays are not changed, the discretionary caps are not changed, nor is the Labor Committee reconciled the additional spending. Since the stated intent of the amendment is not binding, the only effect of this amendment is to increase Function 400 education spending (budget authority only) in the year 2000.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The text appears to be discussing internal agency deliberations and decision-making related to budget authority and spending, which could be considered privileged information. Additionally, the language suggests that the amendment may not have a significant impact on actual policy or outcomes, further supporting the argument that it is a privileged communication rather than a public record.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; During the debate, there was a great deal of confusion about the amendment and and many members (including possibly Senator Domenici) apparently thought it was a Sense of the Senate. The education community is concerned that some will represent this as a test vote on vouchers (the Senate has always filibustered vouchers in the past) but I'd chalk it up to confusion and play down the voucher piece of this.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, the passage in question does not involve any government agency or communication between government officials. It is a statement made by an individual expressing their opinion on a political issue. Therefore, it is not covered by FOIA exemption 5.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; In any event, there is common agreement internally that the amendment should be dropped in conference.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The statement suggests an internal discussion or decision-making process within a government agency, which would likely be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5. Additionally, the statement implies a level of candidness and frankness that is often necessary for effective decision-making within government agencies, and that could be chilled if such communications were subject to public disclosure.

Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are privileged and contain predecisional or deliberative information. The phrase ""predecisional draft"" indicates that the document is a draft of a decision that has not yet been made, and therefore contains predecisional information. The instruction ""DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE"" further indicates that the document is not intended for public dissemination and is likely a confidential communication between government officials. Therefore, the document would likely be protected under exemption 5."

Explain your reasoning.; ; DISCUSSION PAPER:	It is possible that the discussion paper could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the discussion paper contains confidential or privileged information, such as legal advice or deliberative process materials, it may be exempt from disclosure. However, if the information in the discussion paper is purely factual and not related to any agency decision-making process, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether the discussion paper is exempt from disclosure under exemption 5 would depend on the specific content of the document and the agency's justification for withholding it.

D0	D1	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Developed countries are responsible for more than 75% of the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. In the decades ahead, however, emissions from developing countries are expected to grow sharply. By 2035, developing country emissions are expected to exceed those from the developing world.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be part of a decision-making process. It is a factual statement about greenhouse gas emissions and their expected growth in developing countries.
D0	D1	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Per capita emissions vary widely. Carbon emissions from the United States are roughly 5 tons per person; from the OECD as a whole, roughly 3.5 tons per person; and from developing countries as a whole, roughly 0.5 tons per person.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided does not fall under this category and is not related to any privileged or confidential communication.
D0	D1	D0	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The Framework Convention on Climate Change, signed at the Rio ""Earth Summit"" in 1992, established differentiated levels of commitments for developed and developing countries. It called upon developed countries to take the lead in addressing climate change and to aim to return emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. It called upon developing countries to adopt policies and measures to address climate change, but provided no aim for developing countries similar to the year 2000 goal. These differentiated commitments were intended to recognize both the unequal contribution of developed and developing countries to global greenhouse gas concentrations and the unequal capacity of those countries to control emissions."	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in this example is a description of a global agreement and its differentiated commitments, which is not a privileged communication or a deliberative process material.
D0	D1	T0	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; In 1995, in Berlin, the Parties to the climate treaty agreed to negotiate steps for controlling greenhouse gas emissions beyond the year 2000. The negotiating mandate calls on developed countries to set quantified emissions limits for the ""medium term ( e.g. 2005, 2010 and 2020)."" In Berlin, the United States argued strongly that developing countries must participate meaningfully in negotiations over next steps. There was little support for the U.S. position on this point, with many Parties noting the failure of most developed countries to take significant steps toward meeting the year 2000 goal. The Berlin Mandate states that there will be ""no new commitments"" for developing countries in the current round of negotiation, but that developing countries will be required to advance the implementation of their existing commitments."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The negotiating positions and arguments made by the United States and other Parties could be considered privileged information that is part of the deliberative process leading up to the final decision. However, it would depend on the specific circumstances of the case and whether the information is deemed to be pre-decisional and deliberative.
T0	T0	T0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 2. Kyoto Negotiations: Current Status	It is possible that the information regarding the current status of the Kyoto Negotiations could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the information is considered privileged, such as confidential diplomatic communications or legal advice, it may be exempt from disclosure under this exemption. However, if the information is already publicly available or does not meet the criteria for exemption 5, it may still be subject to disclosure under FOIA. Ultimately, the determination of whether the information is exempt under exemption 5 would depend on the specific circumstances and content of the information.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; This is the most difficult issue in the current round of negotiations. There is a vast gulf between the dialogue abroad (where the U.S. proposal for developing country participation is almost uniformly considered too aggressive) and at home (where more than 60 Senators have signed a resolution insisting on developing country commitments beyond those contemplated in either the U.S. proposal or current negotiating mandate).	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing internal deliberations and negotiations within the U.S. government regarding developing country participation in some sort of international agreement. The fact that there is disagreement and debate within the government suggests that this is a sensitive issue that officials may not want to disclose publicly. Therefore, it is likely that this statement would be considered privileged and exempt from FOIA disclosure.

Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are privileged and confidential. The phrase ""predecisional draft"" indicates that the document is a preliminary draft that has not yet been finalized or approved. As such, it falls under the category of pre-decisional documents that are exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5. Additionally, the instruction ""DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE"" suggests that the document is intended to be kept confidential and not shared with the public."
T0	T0	T0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A. U.S. Protocol Proposal	It is possible that the U.S. Protocol Proposal could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including attorney-client communications, attorney work product, and deliberative process privilege. If the proposal contains legal advice or analysis provided by an attorney, or if it reflects the agency's internal deliberations or decision-making process, it may be exempt from disclosure under this exemption. However, if the proposal contains purely factual information or is not related to the agency's decision-making process, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether the U.S. Protocol Proposal is exempt from disclosure under exemption 5 would depend on the specific content and context of the proposal.
D0	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; In January, 1997, the U.S. submitted a draft protocol proposal. Provisions on developing countries included three elements: (I) calling for the negotiation by 2005 of a new agreement with legally binding emissions targets for all countries, including developing countries, and a ""graduation mechanism"" under which Parties would automatically assume additional obligations as their living standards increase (the ""evolution"" concept); (2) establishing a new category (Annex B) of commitments for the most advanced developing countries (providing a halfway house between commitments of developing countries and the more extensive obligations ofOECD members); and (3) an elaboration of existing commitments (defining what would be meant by ""continuing to advance the implementation of existing commitments""). This final element contained several components, including a requirement to report annually on emissions and actions taken to reduce emissions and take ""no regrets"" actions (actions which would benefit the climate system, but which might be taken for other economic or environmental reasons)."	It is possible that some portions of this document could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. Specifically, any internal deliberations or communications related to the development of this proposal could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, the actual proposal itself, as well as any information related to its content or implementation, would likely not be protected under exemption 5. This is because exemption 5 is intended to protect the decision-making process of government agencies, not the substance of their decisions or policies. As such, any information related to the proposed emissions targets, graduation mechanism, or reporting requirements would likely be subject to disclosure under FOIA.
D0	D1	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; B. Reaction Abroad	"It is not clear what specific information or document is being referred to as ""Reaction Abroad."" Without more context, it is difficult to determine whether it would be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 generally applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. If ""Reaction Abroad"" refers to such communications, it may be protected under exemption 5. However, if it refers to information that is not privileged or related to agency decision-making, it would not be protected under exemption 5."
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Support for the U.S. proposal is scant. While the third element is considered within the ambit of the Berlin Mandate by nearly all Parties, most countries have argued that the other two elements (i.e., evolution and Annex B) are beyond its scope. The U.S. has been urged to drop its proposal for a new annex. We have also been urged to drop our proposal for evolution (in favor of a separate agreement at some future date).	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing internal deliberations and negotiations related to a proposed policy, and the language suggests that it may be part of a larger document or conversation that is not intended for public release. As such, it could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under FOIA.

They have supported U.S. proposals for advancing existing commitments, and have proposed that Mexico and Korea take on stronger commitments (not too far removed in substance from the U.S. Annex B), but are not prepared to accept the U.S. language on ""Evolution"" adopted as part of the Kyoto agreement. They do not support joint implementation with developing countries."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The information appears to be discussing internal deliberations and negotiations between the US and the EU regarding climate change commitments, which could be considered privileged. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific context and whether the disclosure of this information would harm the government's ability to conduct effective negotiations.

This group of countries broadly supports including developing country obligations under the Kyoto Agreement. Australia and Canada are the most vocal in support of action, while Japan, as host of the December session, is concerned that an aggressive approach would potentially derail the negotiations. As nearly all countries in this bloc have extensive competitive trade outside of the OECD, they are more aggressive in demanding developing country action With the exception of Japan, this group supports joint implementation.	Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The information appears to be a summary of discussions or positions taken by non-EU OECD members during negotiations related to the Kyoto Agreement. As such, it could be considered part of the internal deliberative process of the agency involved in the negotiations and therefore exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.

These three countries are the primary drivers of the developing country position - and some of the world's largest emitters (China is second after the U.S., and India is number six). These	statements would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional, deliberative, and privileged. The statements about China, India, and Brazil are factual and do not involve any inter-agency or intra-agency communications. Therefore, they would not be protected under exemption 5.

They claim that when developing countries have incomes and per capita emissions equal to those of the North, they will then participate in the clean-up effort. In spite of their often strident public rhetoric, these countries (particularly China and Brazil) have shown a willingness to engage on this issue on a bilateral basis. They have active domestic climate change mitigation efforts, and have privately indicated a support for many elements of the U.S. proposal. However, they all oppose joint implementation.

Well organized in the climate negotiations, the OPEC countries have been led by Saudi Arabia and Nigeria, and advocate positions designed to slow or block the negotiations. These countries have strongly urged: (I) that developing countries should not have to act now, and (2) that industrialized countries should compensate developing countries that might be affected by any action taken in industrialized countries to reduce emissions (principally noting that reduction in oil revenues should be compensated).	Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The information appears to be based on diplomatic communications or negotiations between countries, which would likely be considered privileged and confidential. Additionally, disclosing this information could harm ongoing diplomatic efforts and relationships between the United States and OPEC countries.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Small Island States. A group of 37 small island states have banded together to create an alliance (AOSIS) that seeks to balance OPEC's influence. Largely composed of member countries with low lying territory which will be gradually inundated by climate-associated sea level rise, these countries have pushed an aggressive next steps to combat the problem - calling for a 20 percent reduction in industrialized country emissions below 1990 levels by the year 2005. The AOSIS countries have been reluctant to support U.S. calls for developing country action; their proposal omits any mention of any developing country commitments to be undertaken as part of the Kyoto agreement, and they oppose JI.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The information pertains to international negotiations and discussions, and may involve confidential or sensitive communications between government officials. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific context and content of the information in question, as well as any applicable exemptions or exceptions.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; An agreement in Kyoto that includes the current U.S. developing country position will be extremely difficult to achieve. State Department believes that, at a minimum, this would require U.S. support for a target and timetable perceived by the rest of the world to be serious, an aggressive effort to support replenishment of the Global Environment Facility, and an intensive diplomatic campaign. Even with these elements, an agreement that includes the U.S. developing country position will be very difficult to achieve.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language used in the passage suggests that it is part of an internal State Department communication, and the content of the communication involves the agency's strategy and analysis related to international negotiations. As such, it is likely that the State Department would consider this information to be privileged and exempt from disclosure under FOIA.

The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as it does not fall under the category of inter-agency or intra-agency communications. FOIA exemption 5 only applies to documents that are part of the decision-making process within the government, such as drafts, memos, and other internal communications. The statement made by Senator Byrd is a public statement made outside of the government and is not related to any internal government decision-making process.

Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are privileged and contain predecisional or deliberative information. The phrase ""predecisional draft"" indicates that the document is a draft of a decision that has not yet been made, and therefore contains predecisional information. The instruction ""DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE"" further indicates that the document is not intended for public dissemination and is likely a confidential communication between government officials. Therefore, the document would likely be protected under exemption 5."
D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The resolution quickly garnered 60 co-sponsors. As drafted, the resolution appears inconsistent with the current negotiating mandate (which does not envision quantified emissions limits for developing countries). During the past several weeks, however, there has been considerable discussion with Senator Byrd and others about the exact meaning of the resolution. Senator Byrd has stated that commitments of developing countries should be based upon their own ""pace of industrialization."" Senator Chaffee has prepared a more moderate resolution that would require developing countries to take on commitments with a I 0-year lag behind the commitments of developed countries."	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language suggests that there have been internal discussions and negotiations about the resolution, and the mention of specific senators indicates that this is likely a communication between or within government agencies. Additionally, the language suggests that there may be differing opinions or interpretations of the resolution, which could be considered privileged information.

Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The original vision of the Framework Convention on Climate Change is that developed countries would lead in controlling greenhouse gases, and developing countries would follow. This is similar to the approach in the Montreal Protocol (the 1987 treaty that addresses stratospheric ozone depletion). Under that agreement, developing country obligations generally follow 10 years behind those of developed countries. Developing countries receive financial assistance for their efforts from a multilateral fund.	Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The information pertains to international negotiations and agreements, which often involve sensitive diplomatic discussions and negotiations. Additionally, the information may be subject to executive privilege, which allows the President to withhold certain information from disclosure in order to protect the confidentiality of communications within the executive branch.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Under this model, long-term engagement of developing countries depends on action by developed countries to control emissions. However, the Byrd resolution underscores the domestic political difficulties associated with differentiated commitments between developing and developed countries. In addition, any competitiveness or leakage issues would present substantive concerns.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. The statement provided does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be deliberative in nature. It is a statement of fact and opinion regarding the challenges associated with long-term engagement of developing countries in controlling emissions.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Many developing nations are addressing their own domestic air pollution problems and other environmental threats and in doing so are curbing releases of greenhouse gases. Independent power producers are building many new, cleaner-burning power plants in developing countries, also reducing greenhouse gas emissions relative to traditional technologies. Renewable energy technologies are finding increasing application among the billions of people in the developing world who are off the electricity grid.

Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Various efforts are underway to encourage developing countries efforts to control greenhouse gas emissions. These include: U.S. bilateral assistance; multilateral assistance through the Global Environment Facility (GEF); calls for reorienting the loan guidelines for the international lending institutions; and work on joint implementation (which would encourage the private sector to undertake projects in developing countries to reduce emissions and claim credit for these reductions against a domestic obligation). The first of these, announced in the President's New York statement at the U.N. Special Session on the Environment, establishes a$ I billion, five-year package to help	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

However, exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are privileged and confidential. The exemption covers documents that are pre-decisional, deliberative, and contain opinions, recommendations, or advice. Therefore, whether the information provided would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 would depend on the nature and content of the document in question.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; developing countries plot a climate friendly path to development. The primary component of this initiative will be a five year minimum of at least $150 million per year in bilateral assistance for climate related programs, and the potential to use development credits dedicated to climate friendly investment projects. The initiative will also include a $25 million 5-year interagency program to assist developing countries to meet the terms of the climate treaty. A significant focus in this initiative will be on using credit tools to induce greater U.S. private sector involvement in transferring climate friendly technologies.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language used in the passage suggests that it may be part of an internal government discussion or planning process, and therefore could be considered privileged. However, without more context it is difficult to say for certain whether exemption 5 would apply.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Our financial contribution to the GEF was one of the original incentives to developing countries to support the Framework Convention on Climate Change - and to take action to mitigate climate change. However, while the U.S. had pledged a contribution of $430 million to the GEF over a three year period, Congressional funding has lagged considerably. FY96 and FY97 contributions were at $35 million rather than $1 JO million. The reduced U.S. contribution to the GEF will make any subsequent calls for developing country action under the climate treaty much more difficult to sustain.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement discusses internal government deliberations and decisions regarding funding for the GEF, which could be considered privileged information. Additionally, the statement may contain sensitive information about the government's negotiating position and potential impact on international climate change efforts, which could also be protected under exemption 5.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; One of the most significant elements of the U.S. approach to encourage developing country participation is joint implementation (JI). Similar to the concept of emissions trading, JI allows countries to offset emissions at home through projects undertaken elsewhere. However, unlike the situation in emissions trading, under a JI regime, projects could be undertaken in developing countries - countries without legally binding emissions budgets. The analytic work performed to date suggests that allowing JI could reduce costs within the U.S. substantially. Developing countries see benefits as well, in the form of technology transfer and private sector investment flows. In spite of the potential benefits, significant opposition among developing countries remains (although support has grown significantly in Latin America). Many developing countries believe that JI could undercut the commitment of developed countries to take the lead in controlling greenhouse gas emissions; some environmentalists are concerned that measuring project-based emissions reductions will be too difficult; and some in the private sector and Congress are concerned that JI will result in significant transfers of wealth overseas.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The passage appears to be discussing internal deliberations and analysis related to U.S. policy on joint implementation, which could be considered pre-decisional and deliberative. However, whether or not this information would actually be protected would depend on the specific context and circumstances of the request.

The memorandum appears to be a communication between agency officials regarding a proposed revision to a draft executive order, which could be considered privileged information related to the agency's decision-making process.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; As you know from our several discussions, EPA believes that one of the principles underlying the Executive Order should be our efforts to share with the public how much we do and do not know about the effects of regulatory actions upon children. The current draft (2.5 pm.1) generalizes this objective through the annual report requirement in section 3-304.  While useful, we do not believe that this goes far enough in addressing the draft Order's basic objective of either protecting children, affirmatively explaining why an agency may be making a different choice, or indicating that information is lacking to allow for a fully informed decision on child-specific concerns.	This statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, this statement does not contain any deliberative information or opinions related to a specific decision or policy. Instead, it discusses a general objective and the EPA's belief that the current draft does not go far enough in achieving that objective. Therefore, this statement would likely be subject to disclosure under FOIA.

Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing legal strategy and potential litigation consequences, which could fall under the deliberative process privilege. This privilege protects communications that are part of the decision-making process and are intended to be confidential in order to encourage frank and open discussion. Therefore, this statement may be withheld from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.

Explain your reasoning.; ; We therefore propose including the following language, added as subsection (d) of 5-501:	It is not possible to determine whether the proposed language would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 without additional context. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.

It is intended only to require neutral explanations of the information used to reach the judgments contained in a regulatory action.	Yes, the statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing the potential impact of a proposed policy change on the agency's legal exposure, which could be considered a privileged communication related to the agency's decision-making process. Additionally, the statement suggests that the proposed language is intended to provide a neutral explanation of the agency's decision-making process, which could be considered part of the agency's deliberative process and therefore protected under exemption 5.

The topics it is intended to encompass are inconsistent, unclear, and confusing throughout the document. Commas make a big difference here. It is one thing to address protecting children in environmental health and safety actions. It is far broader and more complex to do so for environmental, health and safety actions, where health and safety must be considered separately and not just in relation to the modifier ""environmental."" If the intent is to have this order affect just environmental health and safety concerns, as much of the language implies, the wording needs extensive revision to make this clear. If not, the effects are so broad that this issue needs extensive discussion--it is inappropriate to be asked to agree to something this sweeping out of the blue in one day.

We would ask that the President dedicate this action to Elizabeth Glaser and her work to improve child health, and that the Pediatric AIDS Foundation be included in the event.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials.

This could be accomplished in the definitions section and by including a statement in the opening section along the lines of EPA's comments this morning (e.g., the science indicates problems manifest in younger children; therefore, the focus of the E.O. is on children under 14). We would be willing to explore other options for excluding teenagers 14 and older.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language suggests that the DOL is discussing internal strategy and deliberations regarding the scope of an executive order, which would likely be considered privileged.

Explain your reasoning.; ; While some health or safety agencies have statutory missions predominantly directed toward certain age groups, such as the working-age population or the elderly, other agencies have more general mandates to protect public health or the environment for the benefit of all Americans. The intent of this Executive Order is to assure that the latter agencies adequately consider health and safety hazards to children when developing regulations and programs.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. This statement does not appear to be a communication between or within agencies, nor does it appear to be pre-decisional or deliberative. It is a statement of policy intent and would likely be subject to release under FOIA.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?

If the recommendation was made as part of an internal deliberation process, it may be considered pre-decisional and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, if the decision to include older teenagers has already been made and this recommendation is simply a suggestion for how to implement that decision, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this statement is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific context in which it was made.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; - Section 3-302. The Department of Labor should be included in the IWG. NIOSH should also be included because it does the bulk of the research on occupational safety and health.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. This statement is a recommendation for inclusion of certain agencies in a working group and does not involve any deliberation or decision-making process. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; - Section 3-303(c). Cut sentence requiring pamphlet. Allow IWG to determine best outreach approach.	It is possible that Section 3-303(c) could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The sentence in question may contain internal deliberations or recommendations made by the agency, which could be considered privileged. However, without more information about the context and content of the sentence, it is difficult to make a definitive determination.

Suggest ""For each significant regulatory action initiated after the effective date of this E.O. that addresses the environment, health or safety, each agency shall provide the following information, to the extent practicable. . .”  We need some language to assure that these requirements do not (1) interfere with current rulemakings, and (2) impose huge analytical burdens on the agencies. OSHA risk assessments and regulatory analyses already consume considerable"	time and resources, and adding additional requirements could impede the agency's ability to effectively regulate workplace safety.; ; No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. This section of text is not a communication between agencies or within an agency, but rather a proposed addition to a regulation. It does not contain any deliberative or pre-decisional language, but rather provides a rationale for why certain language should be included in the regulation. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
T0	T0	T0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; FDA COMMENTS ON DRAFT EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH THREATS	The FDA comments on a draft executive order to protect children from environmental health threats would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The comments may contain internal deliberations, opinions, and recommendations that are part of the agency's decision-making process and are therefore exempt from disclosure. Additionally, the comments may be subject to attorney-client privilege or the deliberative process privilege, which protect communications between agency officials and their legal counsel or those that are part of the agency's decision-making process, respectively.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; • While parts of the draft executive order (such as the second bullet) appear to address a wide range of health threats to children. other parts (such as the title and first bullet) appear to be limited to environmental health threats. FDA recommends that the scope of the executive order be broadened beyond just environmental health threats. Limiting an executive order to environmental health threats could imply that the most significant health threats faced by children are environmental ones. In FDA's view. while environmental threats are important, they are not the only significant health threats faced by children.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. The FDA's recommendation regarding the scope of the executive order is likely part of an internal deliberation process, and therefore falls under the deliberative process privilege. This privilege protects communications that are part of the decision-making process, and are therefore considered pre-decisional and privileged. The FDA's recommendation is also likely to contain opinions, recommendations, and advice, which are also protected under this exemption.
D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; • While FDA recognizes the benefit of focusing specific attention on health threats to children, FDA is concerned about layering additional requirements on the regulatory process in circumstances where they will not add ""value” to the process. Thus, FDA recommends that any new analysis regarding effecys on children's health be targeted at regulations that (1) have potential disparate health impacts upon children and (2) are significant regulatory actions as defined in Exec. Order 12866."	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be a recommendation from the FDA regarding the regulatory process, and as such, it may be considered a deliberative communication that is part of the agency's decision-making process. Additionally, the statement reflects the agency's internal policy considerations and may be considered pre-decisional. Therefore, it may be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The first limitation (that an analysis of effects on children be limited to regulations with a potential disparate impact on children) will insure that new regulatory reviews are not required unless there is a specific reason to be concerned about children. The second limitation (that an analysis of effects on children be limited to significant regulatory actions) will target the new analysis to the regulations which have the greatest effects and which are already required to be subject to a formal cost-benefit analysis. If the executive order is targeted in this way, it will formalize what FDA should be - and is - already doing.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. This statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. It is a statement of policy and procedure, rather than a discussion of options or alternatives.
D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; • The draft executive order requires that certain regulations be ""adequately protective” of children's health. FDA suggests that this standard be made less vague and more affirmative by requiring that the regulations ""protect"" children's health. In addition, whichever standard is used, it may be necessary to clarify that the requirement to protect children's health applies ""to the extent permitted by law.”  Without such a qualification, the executive order could be construed as an attempt to override existing statutory authorities."	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language in this draft executive order appears to be part of an internal deliberation process between the FDA and other agencies, and is likely considered privileged communication. Additionally, the discussion of potential legal implications suggests that this is part of a legal analysis or advice, which would also be protected under exemption 5.
D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; • The draft executive order also requires an “affirmative finding"" that certain regulations are, adequately protective of children’s health. A better approach might be to follow the Food Quality Protection Act and require ""a specific determination regarding the safety ... for infants and children (sec. 408(b)(2)(C)(ii)(II)). The specific determination language) has the advantage of not requiring an affirmative finding where this would be impossible due to lack of complete information or a conflicting statutory mandate."	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be a discussion of legal and policy considerations related to a potential executive order, and as such, it could be considered part of the agency's deliberative process. This type of communication is typically protected under exemption 5 to encourage open and candid discussions within agencies.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; FDA does not object to restricting the pamphlet for families (which is addressed in the third bullet) to just environmental health threats. However, FDA does have questions about implementation, including whether the pamphlet is a one-time project or an annual one, whether a significant commitment of resources will be required, and who will take the lead in preparing the pamphlet.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing internal deliberations and questions about the implementation of a project, which would likely be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.

We had a number of serious concerns about the previous draft of this Executive Order, and we are pleased to see many of the changes that have been made to address those concerns."	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, the statement provided does not contain any deliberative information or opinions related to agency decision-making. Instead, it expresses the agency's support for a national policy to protect the health of American children from environmental, health, and safety hazards. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; This memo outlines our most serious remaining concerns with the contents of the current draft Order. We also anticipate that we may have more comments, questions, and recommendations once we have reviewed the comments of other participating agencies. Finally, we are still reviewing the Preamble to the draft Order, and may have further comments after that review is completed.	The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The memo appears to be an internal communication between agency officials discussing their concerns and recommendations regarding a draft order. As such, it would likely be considered a privileged communication that is exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Section 1-102: This section is overly prescriptive and could arguably require agencies to spend unlimited resources to address a particular hazard, unless prohibited by statute.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are privileged and would not be available to a party in litigation. The statement provided does not fall under this category as it is not a communication between agencies or within an agency. It is a statement about a section of a law and its potential impact on agency resources. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.

The statement provided does not fall under any of the categories of privileged information protected by exemption 5.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Section 3. Children's Health IWG	It is not possible to determine whether Section 3. Children's Health IWG would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 without additional context. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. Therefore, it depends on the content of Section 3 and whether it contains inter-agency or intra-agency communications that would be exempt from disclosure under this exemption.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; We agree that there needs to be coordination among federal agencies on children's health and safety issues, particularly in the area of research. However, as originally drafted, the Executive Order would have established a new Children's Environmental Health Council with a broad mandate that went well beyond simple coordination among agencies, CPSC staff commented that the creation of a new, cumbersome bureaucratic entity was counter to the Administration's reinvention efforts, and that its broad responsibilities could impose inappropriate burdens and mandates on member agencies. While we are pleased that the original proposal has been considerably scaled back, we still have a number of concerns about the proposed lnteragency Working Group (IWG). 1/ P1// Sections 3-301 and 3-302. We agree with many of the comments that have been made by representatives of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (CIRA) about creating a new bureaucracy to coordinate efforts among agencies. We are eager to review OIRA's written comments and recommendations to revise this proposal.	The passage would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter- or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would be privileged in civil litigation. The passage discusses internal agency deliberations and concerns about a proposed policy, and includes references to comments made by representatives of another agency (OIRA). These discussions are likely part of the agencies' decision-making process and would be considered deliberative. Additionally, the passage does not contain any factual information that would be required to be disclosed under FOIA.

If the section contains internal deliberations or communications related to the development of the coordinated Federal strategy, it may be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. However, if the section contains factual information or other non-privileged material, it may not be protected under exemption 5 and could be subject to disclosure under FOIA. Ultimately, the determination of whether this section is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific content and context of the information.

"The statement regarding ""guiding principles"" and ""general policy"" would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The statement in question does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be a pre-decisional document.

FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, this statement does not involve any deliberative process or decision-making. It is simply a question and a comment about potential redundancy in the language of a statute. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.

Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement expresses the agency's position on a policy matter and could be considered part of the agency's decision-making process.

It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the decision to delete the requirement to prepare a cross-cutting budget was made as part of an internal deliberative process, such as a discussion among agency officials about the best way to allocate resources, then it could be considered a privileged communication. However, if the decision was made as a matter of routine administrative procedure, or if it was based on external factors such as changes in funding or policy priorities, then it would not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this information is exempt from FOIA disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the decision to delete the budget requirement.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; (c) Delete the second sentence of this subsection.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to privileged communications, such as those protected by attorney-client privilege or executive privilege.

D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; (d) Delete the word ""ten.”"	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications, such as those between an attorney and client or those that would reveal agency decision-making processes. Deleting a single word does not fall under this category and would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Scope: CPSC already focuses Its priorities and efforts on protecting children from injury and death. We endorse an Executive Order to help advance children's health and safety issues government-wide, and would recommend that the CPSC adhere to its terms. However, it would be inappropriate, for example, to alter an Independent agency's statutory rule making requirements through an Executive Order.  Indeed, the administration implicitly recognized this principle In E.O. 12868, which exempts independent agencies from Its provisions that directly affect an agency's regulatory authority (see E.0. 12866, sec. 6), and requires those agencies only to prepare a ''regulatory plan"" and ""regulatory agenda."" (E.O. 12866, sec. 4(b) and (c).)

The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement is a legal analysis and interpretation of a Supreme Court case, and as such, it falls under the deliberative process privilege. This privilege protects communications that are part of the decision-making process and are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. The statement is also likely to be protected under the attorney-client privilege, as it is a legal opinion provided by an attorney to a client (in this case, an agency).

For example, the term “potential impacts” needs to be clarified in such a way to better define and/or limit when a federal agency must consider the effect of what it does on the health and safety of children. The definition of ""significant regulatory action” should be clarified to exclude regulatory actions which are unlikely  to affect the health and safety of children. The annual reporting requirement in  Section 5-501 should be discretionary so that a report will not be required if an agency determines that there is nothing to report. It is also unclear what impact the proposed EO will have on an agency's budget for research or the degree to which the EO will impact an agency's contractual relations."	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

Explain your reasoning.; ; In framing this concept we have agreed to a commitment to work with parents, scientists, the business community, and others to achieve the goals of getting better information to families. As we work with the stakeholders we can build on the concept of a family's right to know, and decide whether legislation is or is not needed to achieve our goals. As the Administration moves forward we should continue to emphasize our belief that we can achieve our goals in a common sense, cost effective way. That emphasis is needed to respond to concerns that we will put into place unnecessarily expensive approaches. I plan to continue to be involved in this initiative; please contact Diane Regas of my staff with new information as it arises.	It is possible that this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing internal agency deliberations and strategy regarding a policy initiative, and may contain privileged advice or recommendations.

Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The email appears to be an internal communication between two individuals within an agency, discussing a draft policy document. As such, it may contain privileged information or deliberative process material that is exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; While we believe the revised discussion draft of the Children's Environmental E.O. is much improved, as I noted in the voice mail I left for you on Friday, it still presents problems for DOL programs. We have developed several options that we believe would eliminate the burden for DOL without affecting the basic thrust of the E.O. As you know, our particular concern is that OSHA and MSHA focus on workplace hazards regardless of who is exposed. They do not address risk to particular demographic groups, but to all workers.	Yes, this could potentially be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language suggests that the author is discussing internal agency deliberations and potential solutions to a problem, which could be considered privileged information. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific context and whether the information meets the criteria for exemption 5.

Explain your reasoning.; ; The following options are in order of our preference, with one of the first three strongly preferred to the fourth:	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided does not appear to fall under any of these categories and is simply a statement of preference. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.

Add to definitions: Disproportionate or disproportionately affect does not include any safety or health hazard or risk that occurs in workplaces in which the regular exposure of children to the hazard or risk cannot reasonably be anticipated.	It is unlikely that this would be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not appear to be a communication between government officials that would qualify for the exemption. Rather, it is a proposed addition to a definition, which would not typically be considered a privileged communication. Additionally, the content of the proposed addition does not appear to involve any deliberative process or policy-making, which are the types of communications that are typically protected under exemption 5.

The memorandum is a communication between White House staff members regarding environmental issues for the State of the Union address, which could be considered part of the deliberative process of the executive branch. As such, it may be exempt from disclosure under exemption 5 to protect the candid and confidential exchange of ideas and opinions that is necessary for effective decision-making.
D0	D1	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; There are two leading ideas for an environmental message in the State of the Union Address. This memo gives you a short background and status on each.	It is possible that this memo could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. If the memo was created as part of an internal deliberative process, such as a discussion among White House staff about the content of the State of the Union Address, it could be considered pre-decisional and deliberative, and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, if the memo simply provides factual information without any analysis or recommendations, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether the memo is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific circumstances surrounding its creation and intended use.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Background In August the President directed federal departments to identify ways to provide better information to families about products that pose a special risk to children. Since that time, EPA has been working on a proposal to fulfill this direction. The proposal on the table has two components: first is an Executive Order that would direct federal departments to consider all information about risks to kids when developing environmental health standards, second is principles for toxics labeling legislation.	The proposal on the table would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The proposal involves internal discussions and deliberations within the EPA regarding potential policy changes and legislative proposals, which would likely be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under this exemption. Additionally, the proposal involves the development of potential executive orders, which would also likely be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure.
D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The Executive Order, the ""Children's Environmental Health Executive Order"" would require departments, when taking regulatory action, to make a finding either that the action protects children or that there is insufficient information to make such a determination. In addition, the draft creates a ""Children's Environmental Health Council"" to oversee the implementation of the Executive Order, to coordinate federal research, and, among other duties, to consult with OIRA on regulatory actions that may affect children's environmental health."	"The information regarding the ""Children's Environmental Health Executive Order"" and the creation of a ""Children's Environmental Health Council"" would likely not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. This information does not appear to involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications, but rather describes a proposed executive order and the creation of a council to oversee its implementation. Therefore, it is unlikely that exemption 5 would apply."
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The primary conceptual questions about the Executive Order are: which federal actions should be covered; how should federal departments deal with limited information; and whether the Executive Order is consistent with the Administration's position on regulatory reform legislation. The draft text has been in circulation only a few days, and I expect that new issues will arise based on the text. (Our next interagency meeting is Tuesday, January 28.)	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language suggests that the author is discussing internal agency deliberations and considerations about the Executive Order, which would likely be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. Additionally, the mention of an upcoming interagency meeting further suggests that this is an internal communication not intended for public release.
D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The second part of the proposal, principles for labeling legislation, would express the Administration's support for a requirement that manufacturers label products with information about special risks to children. This proposal is modeled on ""Proposition 65"" a ten year old law in California. The key to the proposal is that it does not add to government regulation of product content, instead it requires manufacturers to test products and label them appropriately. The government's role is limited to identifying which substances are of concern, and perhaps identifying level below which labeling will not .be required. Proponents of this approach argue that labeling will provide families with the tools they need to make choices among products and create a strong incentive for manufacturers to reformulate potentially unsafe products. The proposal would exempt food and drugs."	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The passage provided is a proposal for legislation and does not involve any inter-agency or intra-agency communication. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Federal agencies and White House staff have raised concerns about legislation in this arena. There is little solid data regarding the costs and benefits of a national proposal, and the California model has not been rigorously studied. (We lack data on the costs and benefits of the California law partly because companies have been very reluctant to release information about their costs.) In addition, there are difficult trade and small business implications that need to be hammered out.	Yes, the statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing internal deliberations and concerns about proposed legislation, which would likely be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure. Additionally, the statement may contain pre-decisional or deliberative information, which is also protected under exemption 5.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Status The Executive Order is in draft and could probably be finalized quickly if EPA generates support within the White House for that position. The process of coming to closure quickly could, however, cause us to miss some more subtle issues, and will likely lead us to draft an Order that is narrowly tailored to environmental health, rather than considering an approach that applies to all health-based regulations.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. However, this statement does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be pre-decisional or deliberative. It is simply a statement about the potential consequences of drafting an executive order quickly.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; EPA has drafted about a dozen principles to support labeling legislation. While these too could be finalized for the State of the Union, the lack of detailed understanding of the policy and political implications counsel continuing the staff discussions. Both 0MB and NEC have serious concerns about the need for legislation, and how to structure it most efficiently. (Recall that EPA proposed this concept at an NEC meeting in June and the proposal was tabled.)	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language suggests that there are ongoing discussions and deliberations among staff members and between agencies about the proposed labeling legislation, which would likely be considered privileged and confidential. Additionally, the mention of concerns and the need for efficient structuring further supports the argument that this information is part of the agency's internal decision-making process and therefore exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Recommendation The President should commit to issuing an Executive Order to ensure that federal decisions use the best information we can get to protect children, or more narrowly, children's environmental health. The interagency process to finalize the Executive Order could then be completed in coming weeks.	It is possible that this recommendation could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. If the recommendation was made as part of an interagency process to finalize an Executive Order, it could be considered a pre-decisional communication that is protected from disclosure. However, the specific circumstances of the recommendation and the Executive Order process would need to be evaluated to determine if exemption 5 applies.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The discussion of legislative principles should be brought to a deputies' or principals' meeting to allow for a full airing of the issues.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. This statement does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it involve any pre-decisional or deliberative information. It is simply a suggestion for how to handle a discussion of legislative principles. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; American Heritage Rivers	It is possible that American Heritage Rivers could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. This exemption is often used to protect internal deliberations, attorney-client communications, and other sensitive information that could harm the government's decision-making process if disclosed.; ; In the case of American Heritage Rivers, it is possible that there were internal deliberations or communications between government agencies that could be considered privileged. For example, if there were discussions about which rivers should be designated as American Heritage Rivers, or how to allocate funding for the program, these could be considered privileged communications.; ; However, it is also possible that much of the information related to American Heritage Rivers would not be protected under exemption 5. For example, if there were reports or studies conducted on the environmental impact of the program, or on the economic benefits of designating certain rivers as American Heritage Rivers, these would likely not be considered privileged communications.; ; Ultimately, whether or not American Heritage Rivers is protected under FOIA exemption 5 would depend on the specific information being requested and the context in which it was created.
D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Background A new proposal to create a federal designation ""American Heritage River"" is being discussed in a process convened by CEQ. The President would announce a commitment to this idea and work some of the details, including an Executive Order, later. Currently CEQ staff is proposing that identification be based primarily on the cultural value of rivers. The implication of designation is still under discussion, but would include a call for partnerships with the private sector, federal support for local initiatives and federal steps to protect designated waters. Initially departments have raised some concerns: a designation process will create false expectations that we can solve problems in many places; choosing waters for cultural significance conflicts with targeting environmental money to solve problems; as described, the new designation does not clearly add to current work; and we have not thought through potential political opposition."	The information provided in this scenario would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The discussion of concerns and potential opposition related to the proposed American Heritage River designation process would likely fall under the category of pre-decisional deliberative communications, which are protected from disclosure in order to encourage open and candid discussions within agencies. Additionally, the fact that the proposal is still under discussion and has not yet been finalized would further support the argument for exemption 5 protection.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; The biggest challenge we face in making this idea work is to make designation as an American Heritage River meaningful. I am continuing to work with CEQ as they identify ways to accomplish this goal, but I remain concerned that we may not have good solutions by next week. I have attached the current iteration of this idea.	Yes, the statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be a communication between government officials discussing a policy issue and potential solutions, which would likely be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Recommendation There are thousands of people across the country who are working to restore enjoyment of their local waterways, and who would welcome new tools to achieve their ends. They need incentives to create jobs and revitalize rundown urban waterfronts; small grants to catalyze their work; better processes for participating in federal decisions; more information about environmental threats in their local area; and a federal commitment to work in ways that are consistent with local needs. We can do this, and we should focus the effort where people really need it--urban waterways. The current proposal, if it remains focussed on historically or culturally significant waters, is unlikely to bring these tools to communities.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The recommendation provided in the statement does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.

In that case. what is the best way to encourage states to develop seamless systems? I think it is not by setting benchmarks or other rules which encourage the new funds to be used for the not-formerly-on-welfare working poor to counterbalance current practice of focusing dollars on former welfare recipients.

I do also think, as I think you do, that an additional proposal here would be very helpful. I think such a proposal should focus on parents who stay home for more than 6-24 weeks. Thus, I would like to see something like the demonstration project idea, which would provide funds to community and religious groups (including the latter would be helpful) who provide support and assistance to stay-at-home parents, by offering parenting classes or hotlines, play groups, two hour “relief” or “emergency” child care, or which distribute materials to new parents (I though Barry’s idea of promoting connections to WIC was promising).

In fact, in my in-box is the new issue of Univ of Wisconsin Institute on Poverty magazine which highlights an evaluation of a program called Avance that has worked with low-income Hispanic infants and their families in San Antonio since 1973 which has the explicit goal of ""helping mothers become better teachers of their children.""

This provision of Social Security law is specifically for Nazi war criminals and provides for an earlier cut off than for other deportees, whose benefits are not cut off until they are actually deported.	Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The provision of Social Security law described in the statement may involve internal agency deliberations and legal analysis, which could be considered privileged.

SSA found other grounds to cut off benefits to two additional Nazi war criminals, but they could return to the Social Security rolls.	Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

The agencies have developed a legislative proposal.	Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The fact that the DOJ and SSA have been meeting and discussing a legislative proposal suggests that they are engaged in a deliberative process aimed at developing a policy or legal position.

Therefore, the statement would likely be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; In summary, Messrs. Sher and Bloomfield presented a passionate argument that SSA's proposal will hurt prosecutions of Nazi war criminals. They want the status quo left alone and for SSA not to introduce its legislative proposal. They presented the argument that I outlined for you earlier: They deeply believe that some judges will act more sympathetically toward old men who were Nazis if they can argue that not only is the government trying to strip them of their citizenship, but the government is also impoverishing them while they are trying to defend their rights during the judicial process. They think that a single bad outcome in a case could have farreaching implications for other cases. They admit that it is impossible to accurately predict what judges may in fact do, but they hold the view with absolute conviction that this will hurt prosecutions.	This would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents. It is a summary of a presentation made by Messrs. Sher and Bloomfield, and does not involve any internal government deliberations or communications.
D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Obviously, everyone in attendance agreed that we shared the objective of not wanting to do anything to compromise prosecutions of Nazis. SSA and DOJ explained how they engaged in interagency discussions to reach what they jointly view as a proposal that properly balances SSA's concern about ""subsidizing the retirement of Nazis"" with enforcement concerns. It is important to note that DOJ concedes that there remains some possible enforcement implications, but again, they believe that this proposal is an appropriate balancing of policy objectives."	Yes, the passage would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter- or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would be privileged in civil litigation. The passage describes discussions between the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding a proposal related to the retirement benefits of Nazis. The passage includes information about the agencies' policy objectives and their efforts to balance competing concerns.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; In my follow-up with the White House attendees at the meeting, we agree that the specific enforcement concern depends on predictions on what judges may or may not do and therefore does not sound fully compelling EXCEPT that it is impossible to ignore who is raising the concern. These individuals are representatives of those who are the most concerned about and the most effected by this proposal. It gains us very little to close this SSA loophole if taking that action is decried in the strongest possible terms by the victims of those war criminals as undermining their prosecutions.	"Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be discussing legal strategy and considerations related to a specific proposal, and the mention of ""enforcement concern"" and ""predictions on what judges may or may not do"" suggests that it may be part of an internal legal analysis or discussion. Additionally, the statement references ""representatives"" and ""victims"" who may have a stake in the proposal, which could suggest that it is part of a deliberative process within the agency."

Sher and Bloomfield were absolutely clear that they and their organizations would protest vociforously. They would protest in the media, and they would protest in Congress. They would make sure that it is known that the President has introduced legislation that would compromise the prosecutions of Nazis.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process.

Explain your reasoning.; ; On the other hand, they said that if SSA is criticized for making such payments they would engage in whatever steps were necessary to explain to the public, to Members of Congress, and to the media that SSA's policies were sound and that anyone promoting an alternative view would be hurting prosecutions. There is already at least one critical article that has appeared (St. Petersburg Times) and SSA has been contacted by a Tampa CBS affiliate for comment. I think that we can anticipate other critical pieces, and it may be picked up by the national press. Cong. Bunning (R-Ky), chair of the Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee has requested information about the St. Petersburg story.	This statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Given the foregoing considerations, I think that this is a very difficult issue, but I have to recommend to you that we provide guidance to SSA that the proposal should not go forward, Normally, I would give quite a bit of deference to Justice and SSA for the product of a solid interagency process. Nobody wants to provide benefits to Nazis, ESPECIALLY when some of their victims who are legal immigrants may face benefit cut-offs, but we cannot ignore the absolute conviction of those who we heard from who represent the victims when they say that the President will hinder the prosecutions of Nazis with this proposal.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be a recommendation made by an individual within an agency, and it references an interagency process and discussions with representatives of victims. As such, it could be considered a privileged communication that is exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Dawn agrees with this recommendation based upon her participation in the meeting. Public Liaison agrees.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. This statement does not appear to be either pre-decisional or deliberative, but rather a simple agreement or affirmation of a decision that has already been made.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; There is not a drop-dead deadline to drop a legislative proposal. However, the urgency of deciding  arises because the subcommittee Chairman & staff have been asking SSA as recently as  yesterday where they are on solving the problem of Nazi's getting paid. SSA has been putting them off saying that they are continuing to work on the issue. There is a technical mark-up, but this proposal doesn't have to be a technical (in fact it may not be eligible to be a technical). It could be offered later as a stand-alone (or alternatively a member of Congress could offer a bill and we could support that if we chose to) so the 23rd is not magical, but SSA is feeling pressure to get back to the subcommittee Chair fairly promptly.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. This passage does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be pre-decisional or deliberative. It is discussing a deadline and pressure to act on a specific issue, which does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.

SSA anticipates that this may be the beginnning of a lot of bad press about how it provides money for the retirement of Nazis.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement in question does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency that is part of a decision-making process. Instead, it is a statement about a media inquiry and potential negative press. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; This is a no-win situation. We are either going to be criticized for paying retirement to Nazis or we will be criticized because at least several major Jewish organizations will charge us with compromising enforcement. There is going to be critical press whatever the decision is. The straight policy call is probably that we should be able to rely upon the Department of Justice to determine the appropriate enforcement assessment and what will or won't damage prosecutions. And DOJ says they have struck the right balance. However, I don't think that the policy determination can be completely divorced from an assessment of the political overlay on this issue.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be a discussion of policy and legal strategy related to a sensitive issue, and it references the Department of Justice's assessment of the situation. As such, it could be considered a privileged communication between government officials.

If you think it would be helpful, I could set up a meeting between these gentlemen and you (and whoever else you think should be invited) so that you can guage this directly for yourself.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, the statement provided does not appear to be an inter-agency or intra-agency communication, nor does it contain any deliberative information that would harm the decision-making process if disclosed.

Shimabukuro/OPD/EOP cc: Andrea Kane/OPD/EOP Subject: Food stamps and prisoners	It is unclear whether this record would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 as there is no information provided about the content of the record. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. Without knowing the content of the record, it is impossible to determine if it falls under this exemption.
D0	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Here's what I've learned so far: Under the law, prisoners are not to be included in households in determining food stamp allotments. Last year, after GAO reported that this happens too often, Congress passed a law requiring states to establish ""systems to verify and ensure"" that prisoners aren't counted in households. This can include data matching programs with prisons and/or SSA. The law requires all states to do this by 8/1 /98, although USDA can grant 1-year extensions to states."	Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The information pertains to the implementation of a law passed by Congress, and the details of how states are required to comply with that law. This information may involve internal communications and deliberations within government agencies, which would be exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; However, SSA won't be ready to share federal data with states by August, because it hasn't worked out all the bugs of such a system. States can still meet the requirement if SSA isn't ready, for example by matching data with prisons directly. But SSA has the best data and the law specifically says that states that use SSA data are automatically in compliance. USDA is having a big meeting in 2 weeks with a few states, SSA, and prison people to figure out what kind of system is required. There are also privacy issues.	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement discusses ongoing discussions and planning between the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), as well as potential privacy concerns. These discussions and planning may involve privileged communications and deliberations that are exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; (FYI, there is a similar push on the dead, although that may not be such good fodder for a radio address. GAO just did a report on food stamps going to the dead, and Lugar is doing a hearing on this April 23. SSA also has good data on the dead, so at the hearing USDA has to say whether SSA and USDA can share data on this.)	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement appears to be an internal communication between government agencies discussing ongoing investigations and potential hearings. As such, it could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.

Shimabukuro/OPD/EOP, Laura Emmett/WHO/EDP Subject: Update on prisoners and benefits	It is possible that this record could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, without more information about the content of the record and the context in which it was created, it is difficult to make a definitive determination. It is possible that the record contains legal advice or other privileged information that would qualify for exemption 5 protection, but it is also possible that it is simply a routine update on prisoners and benefits that would not be exempt.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; We met yesterday with Rahm, Gene, Barbara Chow, and SSA on a possible radio address on stopping fraud in benefit payments to prisoners. We agreed that there is some potential in announcing that other agencies (USDA, maybe VA and others) will take advantage of SSA's big new database of prisoners to spot prisoners who are getting benefits. We will work with OMB to survey agencies for programs where this might work. SSA notes Shaw is doing an oversight hearing on SSI fraud this month and that there will be a lot of heat from Congress in coming weeks on fraud, so this would let us take the offensive a bit.	The passage would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The passage appears to be a discussion among government officials about potential policy initiatives and strategies, which could be considered part of the deliberative process. Additionally, the passage includes references to ongoing congressional oversight and potential political pressure, which could further support a claim of privilege.

Raines FROM: Barbara Chow  Chris Sauer cc: Jack Lew Diana Fortuna Peter Orszag RE: Use of SSA prisoner database for other Federal benefit programs	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The memorandum is an internal communication between members of the Executive Office of the President and the Office of Management and Budget, discussing the use of a database for federal benefit programs. This communication is likely considered privileged and confidential, as it pertains to the internal decision-making processes of the agencies involved.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; We have identified some Federal benefit programs which have statutory provisions to reduce or suspend benefits to those incarcerated on a conviction or otherwise institutionalized. This is not a comprehensive list. The entities administering these programs would likely benefit from access to SSA's prisoner database. The following agencies, in our survey of OMB examiners, administer programs with statutory requirements to suspend benefits:	Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The reasoning is that the information pertains to internal agency discussions and decision-making processes related to administering federal benefit programs, and disclosing it could harm the agency's ability to effectively carry out its functions. Additionally, the information may contain deliberative or pre-decisional material that is exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5?

This exemption covers information that is privileged or confidential, including inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The information related to these programs is likely to involve internal deliberations and communications between agencies, and therefore would fall under this exemption. However, information related to the Department of Agriculture would not necessarily be protected under this exemption, as it may not involve the same level of privileged or confidential information.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Some of these programs are State-administered, which could make coordination of timely data matches more difficult.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided does not fall under any of the categories of privileged communications and does not contain any confidential or sensitive information. It is a general statement about the potential challenges of coordinating data matches for state-administered programs, which does not qualify for exemption 5 protection.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Recommendation for Executive Memorandum With respect to the four agencies, identified above, with statutory requirements to suspend benefits, an Executive Memorandum on the issue should require the agencies to conduct matches within a specified period of time with the SSA database to identify ineligible recipients on benefit rosters. Additionally, the Memorandum would require the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration to assist the agencies in whatever ways necessary to allow quick, efficient access to the SSA database. Agencies would be required to design a protocol for matches within a specified period of time, for example 90 days, and perform the first batch of matches within a specified period of time, for example six months. Thereafter, the agencies would be required to match as frequently as practicable but no less frequently than annually.	This recommendation would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications or documents that are pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. Rather, it is a recommendation for an Executive Memorandum that would require specific actions to be taken by multiple agencies, and as such, would likely be considered a final agency action that is subject to disclosure under FOIA.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A quick survey of the programs identified above indicates that up to 20,000 prisoners may be receiving benefits improperly. This estimate is highly uncertain and should be verified with the agencies. Savings estimates, sought from the agencies, ranged from negligible amounts from the Education programs to $75 million from the VA programs. These estimates, again, are highly uncertainty, and better savings estimates should be discussed with the agencies.	The passage would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The passage does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, but rather a summary of findings from a survey conducted by an outside party. Additionally, the passage does not contain any deliberative or pre-decisional information that would be exempt under exemption 5.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; All other agencies with benefit programs would be directed to explore the potential benefits of conducting such a match and, if they determine beneficial to follow the terms above.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. This statement does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it involve any pre-decisional or deliberative process. It is simply a directive to other agencies, which would not be protected under exemption 5.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Proposal of additional statutory requirements  In a note to accompany the Memorandum informally, all agencies that do not currently suspend benefits would be directed to review their program requirements concerning payments of benefits to prisoners using the laws related to the Social Security programs as a model.	The proposal of additional statutory requirements would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. However, the proposal of additional statutory requirements is not a memorandum or letter between agencies or within an agency. It is a proposal for a new policy or requirement, which would not fall under the scope of exemption 5.

No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, the statement provided is a directive from Congress to agencies and the Attorney General, and does not involve any deliberative process or decision-making.

Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The prohibition on SSI eligibility for inmates of public institutions is likely based on internal agency deliberations and policy decisions, which would be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5. Additionally, disclosing this information could potentially harm the agency's ability to effectively administer the SSI program.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; In 1980, legislation was first enacted requiring SSA to suspend payment to individuals convicted of a felony entitled to Social Security disability insurance benefits. This was expanded in 1983 to cover persons entitled to any Social Security benefits. In February 1995, P.L. 103-387 (the independent agency bill) expanded the classes of affected beneficiaries by including individuals convicted of crimes punishable by more than 1 year imprisonment (regardless of actual sentence imposed) and those found not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial.	Yes, this information would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The information pertains to the internal decision-making process of the Social Security Administration (SSA) regarding the suspension of benefits for certain individuals, and may involve legal analysis or advice. As such, it could be considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; In May of 1996, the President submitted legislation to the Congress that was designed  to give SSA the authority to operate an incentive payment program, through which prison and jail facilities would be paid an incentive for providing information leading to the suspension of SSI benefits to inmates, Under the President's proposal, when a  match of prisoner data against SSI data is made and the Information leads to a subsequent suspension of SSI benefits, the facility would be eligible to receive a payment from SSA of $400 or $200 depending on the timeliness of the report. In August of 1996, Congress adopted the President's proposal as part of P.L. 104-193.	This would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it is a legislative proposal and subsequent adoption by Congress.

This passage describes a final decision made by Congress and does not involve any internal agency communications.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; -Other Federal Agencies Some Federal agencies that administer Federal benefit programs operate under laws that require them to suspend benefit payments to individuals while they are in prison. For example, recently enacted Welfare Reform legislation requires the Department of Agriculture to review its food stamp rolls to ensure that incarcerated individuals are not included in monthly food stamp allotments. The Department of Veterans' Affairs, in certain instances, is required to suspend payments to beneficiaries who are in jail. On the other hand, the Railroad Retirement Board, for example. does not suspend benefits to eligible individuals who are incarcerated. Many agencies, including some of those mentioned above, and the Office of Child Support Enforcement, within the Department of Health and Human Services, also need to obtain prisoner information.	"This statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications. Exemption 5 only applies to documents that are ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.""

Explain your reasoning.; ; Focus On Problems When the President took office, there was a lot of work that needed ta be done to establish an efficient and effeetlve prisoner suspension operation within the Social Security Administration. We found that many prison officials were not aware of the statutory provision requiring the suspension of Social Security and SSI payments to inmates.  In addition, there was no formal process for obtaining this Information from the facilities. Many agreements were informal, ad hoc, which made them difficult to administer and control.	No, the given text would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, the given text does not contain any such communication. It only describes the problems faced by the Social Security Administration in establishing an efficient prisoner suspension operation. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for exemption 5 protection.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Because the facilities were not aware of the requirements, many reported only once or twice a year to SSA, often the Information was Incomplete and reported manually. The prison officials viewed the requirement as another unfunded mandate. Additionally, some correctional institutions are reluctant to enter into agreements with SSA because of the potential cost to them when Incarcerated individuals lose their Medicare or Medicaid eligibility	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement does not fall under any of those categories and does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency. It is simply a statement about the reporting practices and attitudes of correctional institutions towards a requirement from the SSA.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; There were serious limitations in SSA's prisoner suspension program. The internal processes were fragmented and lacked adequate controls and most tasks were manual. This resulted in the inability to stop payments to prisoners in a timely manner. Even when agreements were in place, SSA lacked a method for monitoring the facilities' compliance.	The statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement does not contain any privileged communication, but rather describes the limitations and shortcomings of a government program. It would likely fall under the category of information that is subject to disclosure under FOIA.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Moreover across the Federal govemment, there has been no consistent effort for appropriately suspending payments to incarcerated individuals or data sharing  of prisoner information among agencies. Because of the numerous Federal and State statutes that govern the redisclosure of prisoner information, Federal agencies are hindered from sharing prisoner information.	Yes, the statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement discusses the lack of consistent effort and legal barriers to sharing prisoner information among federal agencies, which could be considered internal deliberations or communications related to agency decision-making. As such, it may be exempt from disclosure under exemption 5.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; RESULTS TO DATE Under this Administration, SSA initiated an aggressive course of action that has resulted in significant improvements in the prisoner suspension process. Over the past few years, SSA has completed a major initiative to contact and establish agreements with all correctional facilities across the United States. As a result of this, SSA has agreements with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, all State prisons and the 25 largest local jail systems to provide us prisoner data. In addition, the Agency has agreements with over 3,500 local jails. SSA has worked with Governors, heads of correctional institutions, correctional associations and similar stakeholders to obtain their help and support in providing prisoner data on a regular basis. The cooperation of State and local correctional administrators is critical to the suspension process. SSA has developed an excellent working relationship with these administrators and the associations that represent them.	"No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to materials that are ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" The information provided in this passage does not appear to be a memorandum or letter, nor does it appear to be subject to any legal privilege that would prevent its disclosure. It is simply a description of the actions taken by the SSA to improve its prisoner suspension process, and as such, it would likely be subject to disclosure under FOIA."
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; As a result of these efforts, prisons and jails representing over 99 percent of the nation’s inmate population are reporting the names and Social Security numbers of incarcerated individuals to SSA. Because of our aggressive efforts to obtain information on prisoners, who are not eligible for benefits, well over 100,000 prisoners had their benefits suspended during 1995 and 1996 alone. For the period 1995-2001, our actions will result in the suspension of payments of nearly $3.5 billion. Programs such aa Social Security and Supplemental Security Income need to be protected to ensure! that only those who are eliglble for benefits are receiving them, and we are proud of the significant savings we have achieved.	This statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement is a factual report of the agency's actions and achievements, rather than a privileged communication.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; As noted earlier, there is a need to address the sharing of prisoner information among Federal agencies. Officials from the Food Stamp Program have recently contacted SSA for prisoner information. There needs to be a coordinated effort within the Federal government regarding the sharing of information about incarcerated individuals. This will ensure that all provisions precluding benefits to incarcerated individuals are enforced. In addition, there needs to be a greater recognition of the medical costs associated with the prisoner population particularly those costs associated with aging and addiction.	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement provided does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency that is part of a decision-making process.

Your participation in announcing the members and at the inaugural meeting of the commission would send a strong signal to the American people to get involved in this effort.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. The decision memo and information about the vetting process for the Commission on Drug-Free Communities could be considered pre-decisional and deliberative, as they relate to the internal discussions and considerations leading up to the announcement of the commission members.

In keeping with the Vice President's reinventing government initiative, the 1998 Strategy sets out a performance measurement system to track the ten-year Strategy. However, substantial Congressional pressure exists for more immediate interim markers, which could cause a legislative response. ONDCP believes that we must proactively craft annual markers that are realistic, achievable, and flexible. Your leadership is necessary to hep the PDPC address this need for greater efficacy and accountability).  Similarly, a series of other issues, including UNGASS, the Southwest border, and restructuring the counter-drug intelligence system, also would benefit from discussions within the PDPC. We are at a critical juncture involving major drug policy initiatives that promise breakthroughs in bringing down drug use in America. A PDPC meeting is vital to ensure unity of effort as we move ahead.	"This would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. The PDPC meeting is a high-level discussion of drug policy issues, and the language used in the passage suggests that the discussion would involve sensitive policy deliberations and recommendations.

The President just signed off on the proposed candidates for the Drug-Free Communities board, and Personnel says that it will take another 4 to 6 weeks to fully vet these folks. I would not, however, recommend this as a stand-alone event. The board does not include any really big names, and the grants are so small ($10 million). Moreover, the Hill Dems were not happy when we did a signing ceremony with the R's on this. They hate that the R's vote against funding for virtually every other community-based drug program -- to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars -- and then turn around and support these tiny grants for community organizations. If anything, we should roll this into the media campaign announcement. It will allow us to say we're linking our national ant-drug message with action at the grass roots.

Your support, and that of all the members of Congress who take their leadership from you, in maintaining unity of purpose is essential.

Several agencies have made similar complaints to ONDCP (e.g., Justice and Treasury). As such, release of the document would be problematic and would imply FY 1999 budgetary trade-offs not yet made in favor of anti-drug spending and against other domestic discretionary spending. We suggest that the document be withheld until after submission of the 1999 President's Budget, when all agencies must submit their performance plans and targets to Congress. Those plans must be directly linked to multi-year Presidential budget request levels.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The document contains internal deliberations and recommendations regarding budgetary trade-offs, which are likely considered privileged and confidential. Additionally, the suggestion to withhold the document until after the submission of the President's Budget indicates that it is part of an ongoing decision-making process, which would also be protected under exemption 5.

Explain your reasoning.; ; The President has taken numerous other actions to combat the problem of drug abuse by offenders involved in the criminal justice system including: doubling the number of federal arrestees drug tested in 24 judicial districts; fighting to launch a $1 billion initiative to spread Drug Courts across the country; and expanding drug testing, intervention and treatment in Federal prisons through his budgets and the 1994 Crime Act.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The statement provided does not fall under either of these categories and is instead a public statement made by the President regarding actions taken to combat drug abuse. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Q. Is the federal government tracking the problem of drug use in its own prisons? What are you doing about the drug problem in federal prisons?	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies, including those protected by attorney-client privilege, work product privilege, or deliberative process privilege. ; ; If the information being requested includes internal communications or documents related to the government's strategy for addressing drug use in federal prisons, it could potentially be considered part of the agency's deliberative process and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, if the information being requested is already publicly available or does not involve privileged communications, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A. Under the leadership of Attorney General Reno, the federal Bureau of Prisons is carrying out model programs in drug testing, drug treatment, and drug detection.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement does not fall under either of those categories and is not related to any privileged communication.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Drug Testing. In 1997, federal inmates were subject to 127,460 drug tests. Two percent of tests were positive, as compared to the 9 percent average for state correctional systems. Prisoners testing positive for drugs are appropriately punished and follow up tests are scheduled regularly to ensure they stay clean. Drug testing of correctional officers, and other selected employees is also an established policy in the Federal Bureau of Prisons.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The information provided about drug testing in federal prisons does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it involve any decision-making process. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Drug Treatment. In compliance with the 1994 Crime Law, drug treatment is provided to 100 percent of eligible inmates prior to their release from Bureau custody. In FY 97, nearly 31,000 inmates participated in Bureau treatment programs. The number of institutions offering residential treatment has grown from 32 to 42 since FY I 994.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in the example does not fall under this category and is therefore not exempt from disclosure under FOIA.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Drug Detection. Innovative drug detection technology is being piloted at Bureau institutions. The Office of National Drug Control Policy is working with the Bureau to provide the states with information on the best ways to keep drugs out of prisons.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The involvement of the Office of National Drug Control Policy suggests that there may be sensitive discussions or recommendations being made that are not intended for public disclosure. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific content of the information and whether it meets the criteria for exemption 5.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Q. Is this new reporting requirement for states on their prison drug problem tantamount to an unfunded mandate on states?	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. This statement is a question about a policy issue and does not involve privileged communications or deliberative processes.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A. No. By law, states must develop and implement plans for drug testing and intervention as a condition of receiving federal prison construction grants. Today's action means that as part of those plans, states will need to add information on their existing prison drug use problem, and update that information annually. All 50 state correctional systems conducted some form of drug testing on their inmates last year; yet no comprehensive data exists on the prevalence on drug use in state prisons. Anecdotal reports have shown that certain systems, such as the District of Columbia's corrections department, have had difficulty keeping drugs out of prisons. The baseline information they provide will help us to chart states' progress to reduce drug use and availability in their prisons.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. The information provided is related to a government program and its implementation, and does not involve any deliberative process or communication between government officials. Additionally, the information is factual and does not involve any opinions or recommendations that would be protected under exemption 5.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; In order to provide additional resources for states to promote coerced abstinence and zero tolerance for drugs, the directive calls on the Attorney General to develop legislation to allow states to use their federal prison construction and treatment funds to carry out all of these activities.	The statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between government agencies. The directive appears to be a communication between government officials discussing potential legislation, which could be considered privileged. However, it is important to note that FOIA exemptions are subject to interpretation and can vary depending on the specific circumstances of the request.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; In addition, the President is proposing $197 million in FY 99 for a series of initiatives to help states promote coerced abstinence and treatment: I) $85 million for a new drug testing, sanctions, and intervention program for states and local criminal justice systems; 2) $30 million for Drug Courts; 3) $4. 7 million for the federal Operation Drug Test program; 4) $5 million for a juvenile justice demonstration program to combat teen drug use; and 5) $72 million to continue the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment in State Prisons program.	It is possible that some portions of this statement could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. Specifically, any internal discussions or deliberations about the proposed initiatives could be considered privileged and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, the actual details of the proposed initiatives themselves would likely not be protected under exemption 5, as they are not inherently privileged or confidential. Ultimately, the determination of whether or not this information is exempt from FOIA disclosure would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding its creation and dissemination.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Q. The President's directive asks the Attorney General to work with states to increase their penalties for smuggling drugs into prisons. Are there tough penalties for trafficking drugs into federal prisons?	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. However, this statement does not involve any communication between agencies or within an agency. It is a simple question about the existence of tough penalties for drug trafficking in federal prisons. Therefore, it does not fall under the scope of exemption 5.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A. Yes. The 1994 Omnibus Crime Act increased penalties for illegal drug use and smuggling drugs into Federal prisons. For instance, drug trafficking in Federal prisons can now lead to imprisonment for up to 20 years for smuggling narcotics and methamphetamine, and up to 5 years for trafficking marijuana.	No, this information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in this statement is a summary of a law and its penalties, which is not a privileged communication.
T0	T0	T0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; DRAFT … DRAFT... DRAFT	"The use of the term ""DRAFT"" alone does not automatically qualify the document for exemption 5 under FOIA. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. If the document in question contains such communications, then it may be protected under exemption 5. However, if the document is simply a preliminary or working draft that does not contain any such communications, it would not be protected under exemption 5. The determination of whether a document is protected under exemption 5 requires a case-by-case analysis of the content and context of the document."
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; January 12, 1998 MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SUBJECT: Zero Tolerance for Drug Use and Availability for Offenders	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The memorandum is addressed to the Attorney General, suggesting that it is an internal communication within the agency. Additionally, the subject matter of the memorandum suggests that it may contain legal advice or opinions, which would also be protected under exemption 5.
D0	D0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Crime rates in this country have dropped significantly for 5 years, and the number of Americans who have used drugs is down nearly 50% from its peak 15 years ago. Also, drug-related murders have dropped to their lowest point in a decade, and recent drug use surveys indicate that -- for the first time in years -- teen drug use is leveling off, and in some instances, modestly decreasing. All of this news is encouraging.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The information provided in this statement does not fall under any of the categories protected by exemption 5.
D0	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Nonetheless, much more can and needs to be done to continue to bring down drug use and increase public safety. With more than half the offenders in our criminal justice system estimated to have a substance abuse problem, enforcing coerced abstinence within the criminal justice system is critical to breaking the cycle of crime and drugs. My Administration consistently has promoted testing offenders and requiring treatment as a means of reducing recidivism and drug-related crime. We have worked to expand the number of Drug Courts throughout the country, increased the number of federal arrestees and prisoners who are tested and treated for drugs, and launched an innovative ""Breaking the Cycle"" initiative, which is a rigorous program of testing, treatment, supervision, and sanctions for offenders at all stages of the criminal justice process. And under your leadership, the Federal Bureau of Prisons provides models of excellence in drug detection, inmate testing, and drug treatment."	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The passage provided does not contain any such privileged communications, but rather discusses policy initiatives and programs related to drug use and criminal justice.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; We can do still more to enforce coerced abstinence among state prisoners, probationers, and parolees. When a drug user ends up in a state prison, we have a chance to break his or her addiction. Convicted offenders who undergo drug testing and treatment while incarcerated and after release are approximately twice as likely to stay drug- and crime-free as those offenders who do not receive testing and treatment. But when drug use inside prisons is ignored, the demand for drugs runs high. In this environment, correction officials struggle to keep their prisons drug-free. Often drugs are smuggled in by visitors; sometimes even by compromised correctional staff.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The passage provided does not contain any such privileged communications.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; To maintain order in our prisons, to make effective treatment possible, and to reduce drug-related crime, we can not tolerate drug use and trafficking within the nation's prisons. Thus, I direct you to:	No, the statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process. The statement provided does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be part of a decision-making process. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; (1) Amend the guidelines requiring states receiving federal prison construction grants to submit plans for drug testing, intervention, and treatment to include a requirement that states also submit a baseline report of their prison drug abuse problem. In every subsequent year, states will be required to update and expand this information in order to measure the progress they are making towards ridding their correctional facilities of drugs and reducing drug use among offenders under criminal justice supervision.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The proposed amendment to the guidelines for federal prison construction grants does not fall under any of the categories of information protected by exemption 5.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; (2) Draft and transmit to the Congress legislation that will permit states to use their federal prison construction and substance abuse treatment funds to provide a full range of drug testing, drug treatment, and sanctions for offenders under criminal justice supervision.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. This provision is not a memorandum or letter between agencies or within an agency, but rather a proposed legislation to be transmitted to Congress. Therefore, it would not be protected under exemption 5.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; (3) In consultation with states, draft and transmit to the Congress legislation that requires states to enact stiffer penalties for drug trafficking into and within correctional facilities.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. This provision is a directive to consult with states and draft legislation, which is not a communication between agencies or within an agency. Additionally, it is not pre-decisional or deliberative, as it is a directive to take action rather than a discussion of potential options.

Maloney/WHO/EDP cc: See the distribution list at the bottom of this message Subject: ""Final Drug Directive"""	It is possible that the record could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The subject line suggests that the record may contain a final directive related to drugs, which could be considered a pre-decisional communication between agency officials. However, without more information about the content of the record and the specific agency involved, it is difficult to make a definitive determination.
D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; To the best of my knowledge and efforts this has been signed off on by DOJ, ONDCP and WH Counsel. Some of the added language on ""enforcing coerced abstinence"" are Rahm's rhetorical flourishes. The new language also alludes to including probationers in bullets #1 and #2 (mine and ONDCP's addition; Justice is okay though)."	"Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement references communications between the Department of Justice, the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and the White House Counsel, indicating that it may contain privileged information or legal advice. Additionally, the statement references ""added language"" and ""bullets"" that suggest the document may be a draft or internal memo, further supporting the argument for exemption 5 protection."

I told ONDCP he'll have to speak to Rahm tomorrow if he has any serious concerns."	Yes, this statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of General McCaffrey and ONDCP (Office of National Drug Control Policy) suggests that this is an internal communication within the government, and the reference to speaking to Rahm (presumably Rahm Emanuel, then White House Chief of Staff) suggests that this is a sensitive matter that may involve privileged discussions. Therefore, it is likely that this statement would be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D0	T0	D0	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Rahm: I'll drop the other paper off to you tonight before I leave.	No, this statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5.

Without more information about the content of the record, it is impossible to determine whether it meets these criteria.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Rahm asked Leanne and I to re-draft the state prisons drug directive that's been on the shelf for some months now and get him a copy today. I just dropped off the attached version and faxed it to DOJ and ONDCP. Originally, he wanted it for the radio address, but I think that's no longer in play. Instead, I believe he wants the directive's imminent signature to make into the coverage tomorrow night on Joe Califano's speech on this topic at the Press Club.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language used in the message suggests that it involves internal deliberations and decision-making processes related to the drafting and dissemination of a government directive. Additionally, the mention of DOJ and ONDCP suggests that the communication involves coordination between different agencies, which could further support a claim of exemption under FOIA.
D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Also, please note that while the concepts in the directive were originally proposed by DOJ -baseline requirement, promoting increased penalties from smuggling drugs into prisons and using prison construction funds for testing/treatment -- our directive proposes a slightly different mechanism. I'm suggesting that funds made available to states for testing/treatment be contigent on their enacting tougher penalties for smuggling drugs into prisons (equivalent to what's in the Crime Bill.
