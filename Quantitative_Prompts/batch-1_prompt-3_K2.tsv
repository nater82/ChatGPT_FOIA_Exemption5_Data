On Monday, a new website will be available connecting teachers, parents, and students to good materials for curriculum and out-of-school math and science learning, drawing on the scientific resources of NASA, the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundations, and other federal agencies involved in math and science. (Thus has been a collaborative effort among more than 40 agencies. It will be ready Monday, but we could also save this for a VP event later this month that could focus more squarely on this website and give more credit to all of the agencies involved.)	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of a collaborative effort among more than 40 agencies suggests that there may be internal communications or deliberations related to the development of the website that could be considered privileged. However, without more information about the specific nature of these communications, it is difficult to say for certain whether exemption 5 would apply.

The amendment came in the form of a second degree to the Wellstone amendment (the Republicans wanted to avoid an up or down vote on Well stone).	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

Outlays are not changed, the discretionary caps are not changed, nor is the Labor Committee reconciled the additional spending. Since the stated intent of the amendment is not binding, the only effect of this amendment is to increase Function 400 education spending (budget authority only) in the year 2000.

Exemption 5 applies to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials.

It called upon developed countries to take the lead in addressing climate change and to aim to return emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. It called upon developing countries to adopt policies and measures to address climate change, but provided no aim for developing countries similar to the year 2000 goal. These differentiated commitments were intended to recognize both the unequal contribution of developed and developing countries to global greenhouse gas concentrations and the unequal capacity of those countries to control emissions."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The reasoning for this is that the information pertains to international negotiations and agreements, which may involve sensitive diplomatic communications between agencies and foreign governments. However, it ultimately depends on the specific context and content of the information in question.
D0	D1	T0	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 1. Background; ; In 1995, in Berlin, the Parties to the climate treaty agreed to negotiate steps for controlling greenhouse gas emissions beyond the year 2000. The negotiating mandate calls on developed countries to set quantified emissions limits for the ""medium term ( e.g. 2005, 2010 and 2020)."" In Berlin, the United States argued strongly that developing countries must participate meaningfully in negotiations over next steps. There was little support for the U.S. position on this point, with many Parties noting the failure of most developed countries to take significant steps toward meeting the year 2000 goal. The Berlin Mandate states that there will be ""no new commitments"" for developing countries in the current round of negotiation, but that developing countries will be required to advance the implementation of their existing commitments."	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The negotiating positions and arguments made by the United States and other Parties during the climate treaty negotiations could be considered privileged information that is exempt from disclosure.

It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The discussion of negotiations and differing opinions between the U.S. and other countries, as well as between Senators and the negotiating mandate, could be considered privileged information related to the decision-making process.

Provisions on developing countries included three elements: (I) calling for the negotiation by 2005 of a new agreement with legally binding emissions targets for all countries, including developing countries, and a ""graduation mechanism"" under which Parties would automatically assume additional obligations as their living standards increase (the ""evolution"" concept); (2) establishing a new category (Annex B) of commitments for the most advanced developing countries (providing a halfway house between commitments of developing countries and the more extensive obligations ofOECD members); and (3) an elaboration of existing commitments (defining what would be meant by ""continuing to advance the implementation of existing commitments""). This final element contained several components, including a requirement to report annually on emissions and actions taken to reduce emissions and take ""no regrets"" actions (actions which would benefit the climate system, but which might be taken for other economic or environmental reasons)."	It is possible that the U.S. Protocol Proposal could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; A. U.S. Protocol Proposal; ; Support for the U.S. proposal is scant. While the third element is considered within the ambit of the Berlin Mandate by nearly all Parties, most countries have argued that the other two elements (i.e., evolution and Annex B) are beyond its scope. The U.S. has been urged to drop its proposal for a new annex. We have also been urged to drop our proposal for evolution (in favor of a separate agreement at some future date).	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language suggests that this is an internal communication within the U.S. government, discussing sensitive negotiations and positions taken by other countries.

U.S. Protocol Proposal; ; The following blocs are active in the negotiations:	It is unclear whether the U.S. Protocol Proposal would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 based on the information provided. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are both predecisional and deliberative in nature. If the U.S. Protocol Proposal is a predecisional and deliberative document created within the government, it may be protected under exemption 5. However, if the proposal has already been finalized and is no longer predecisional or deliberative, it would not be protected under exemption 5. Additionally, if the proposal was created by a non-governmental entity, it would not be subject to exemption 5.

EU support for developing country commitments has been very soft. They have supported U.S. proposals for advancing existing commitments, and have proposed that Mexico and Korea take on stronger commitments (not too far removed in substance from the U.S. Annex B), but are not prepared to accept the U.S. language on ""Evolution"" adopted as part of the Kyoto agreement. They do not support joint implementation with developing countries."	Yes, this could potentially be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The information appears to be discussing diplomatic negotiations and positions taken by the European Union, which could be considered privileged information. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific context and whether the information meets the criteria for exemption 5.

This group of countries broadly supports including developing country obligations under the Kyoto Agreement. Australia and Canada are the most vocal in support of action, while Japan, as host of the December session, is concerned that an aggressive approach would potentially derail the negotiations. As nearly all countries in this bloc have extensive competitive trade outside of the OECD, they are more aggressive in demanding developing country action With the exception of Japan, this group supports joint implementation.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process.

They claim that when developing countries have incomes and per capita emissions equal to those of the North, they will then participate in the clean-up effort. In spite of their often strident public rhetoric, these countries (particularly China and Brazil) have shown a willingness to engage on this issue on a bilateral basis. They have active domestic climate change mitigation efforts, and have privately indicated a support for many elements of the U.S. proposal. However, they all oppose joint implementation.

Yes, the document would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The document is labeled as a predecisional draft and contains information about the negotiating positions of OPEC countries, which could be considered part of the agency's deliberative process. Additionally, the document contains language that could be considered sensitive or confidential, such as the suggestion that developing countries should not have to act now and the call for compensation for potential reductions in oil revenues.

D1	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; 7/21; ; One of the most significant elements of the U.S. approach to encourage developing country participation is joint implementation (JI). Similar to the concept of emissions trading, JI allows countries to offset emissions at home through projects undertaken elsewhere. However, unlike the situation in emissions trading, under a JI regime, projects could be undertaken in developing countries - countries without legally binding emissions budgets. The analytic work performed to date suggests that allowing JI could reduce costs within the U.S. substantially. Developing countries see benefits as well, in the form of technology transfer and private sector investment flows. In spite of the potential benefits, significant opposition among developing countries remains (although support has grown significantly in Latin America). Many developing countries believe that JI could undercut the commitment of developed countries to take the lead in controlling greenhouse gas emissions; some environmentalists are concerned that measuring project-based emissions reductions will be too difficult; and some in the private sector and Congress are concerned that JI will result in significant transfers of wealth overseas.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language used in the passage suggests that it may be a summary or analysis of internal discussions or deliberations within the U.S. government about the potential benefits and drawbacks of joint implementation.

The topics it is intended to encompass are inconsistent, unclear, and confusing throughout the document. Commas make a big difference here. It is one thing to address protecting children in environmental health and safety actions. It is far broader and more complex to do so for environmental, health and safety actions, where health and safety must be considered separately and not just in relation to the modifier ""environmental."" If the intent is to have this order affect just environmental health and safety concerns, as much of the language implies, the wording needs extensive revision to make this clear. If not, the effects are so broad that this issue needs extensive discussion--it is inappropriate to be asked to agree to something this sweeping out of the blue in one day. The aim is difficult to take issue with, but the mechanism and scope need discussion."	This would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not pertain to inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are protected by the deliberative process privilege. Rather, it is a comment on a draft Executive Order and expresses concerns about its clarity and scope.

We propose that the President sign thJ Order in the Oval Office, with children, parents, and pediatricians present. We would ask that the President dedicate this action to Elizabeth Glaser and her work to improve child health, and that the Pediatric AIDS Foundation be included in the event.	No, this would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature.

FDA recommends that the scope of the executive order be broadened beyond just environmental health threats. Limiting an executive order to environmental health threats could imply that the most significant health threats faced by children are environmental ones. In FDA's view. while environmental threats are important, they are not the only significant health threats faced by children.	This document would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The FDA is providing comments on a draft executive order, which is a form of internal agency communication.

Explain your reasoning.; ; FDA COMMENTS ON DRAFT EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH THREATS; ; The first limitation (that an analysis of effects on children be limited to regulations with a potential disparate impact on children) will insure that new regulatory reviews are not required unless there is a specific reason to be concerned about children. The second limitation (that an analysis of effects on children be limited to significant regulatory actions) will target the new analysis to the regulations which have the greatest effects and which are already required to be subject to a formal cost-benefit analysis. If the executive order is targeted in this way, it will formalize what FDA should be - and is - already doing.	This statement would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch. The statement is a comment on a draft executive order and does not contain any privileged legal advice or deliberative process.

D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; FDA COMMENTS ON DRAFT EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH THREATS; ; • The draft executive order requires that certain regulations be ""adequately protective” of children's health. FDA suggests that this standard be made less vague and more affirmative by requiring that the regulations ""protect"" children's health. In addition, whichever standard is used, it may be necessary to clarify that the requirement to protect children's health applies ""to the extent permitted by law.”  Without such a qualification, the executive order could be construed as an attempt to override existing statutory authorities."	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The FDA's comments on a draft executive order would likely be considered an internal communication within the agency, and the agency would likely argue that the comments are protected by the deliberative process privilege, which allows agencies to withhold documents that are part of the decision-making process. The FDA's comments on the draft executive order are likely part of the agency's internal deliberations about how to respond to the order, and disclosing them could harm the agency's ability to engage in frank and open discussions about policy options.
D1	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; FDA COMMENTS ON DRAFT EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH THREATS; ; • The draft executive order also requires an “affirmative finding"" that certain regulations are, adequately protective of children’s health. A better approach might be to follow the Food Quality Protection Act and require ""a specific determination regarding the safety ... for infants and children (sec. 408(b)(2)(C)(ii)(II)). The specific determination language) has the advantage of not requiring an affirmative finding where this would be impossible due to lack of complete information or a conflicting statutory mandate."	This would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, as it does not fall under the category of predecisional or deliberative material.

However, as originally drafted, the Executive Order would have established a new Children's Environmental Health Council with a broad mandate that went well beyond simple coordination among agencies, CPSC staff commented that the creation of a new, cumbersome bureaucratic entity was counter to the Administration's reinvention efforts, and that its broad responsibilities could impose inappropriate burdens and mandates on member agencies. While we are pleased that the original proposal has been considerably scaled back, we still have a number of concerns about the proposed lnteragency Working Group (IWG). 1/ P1// Sections 3-301 and 3-302.

This proposal is modeled on ""Proposition 65"" a ten year old law in California. The key to the proposal is that it does not add to government regulation of product content, instead it requires manufacturers to test products and label them appropriately. The government's role is limited to identifying which substances are of concern, and perhaps identifying level below which labeling will not .be required. Proponents of this approach argue that labeling will provide families with the tools they need to make choices among products and create a strong incentive for manufacturers to reformulate potentially unsafe products.

The President would announce a commitment to this idea and work some of the details, including an Executive Order, later. Currently CEQ staff is proposing that identification be based primarily on the cultural value of rivers. The implication of designation is still under discussion, but would include a call for partnerships with the private sector, federal support for local initiatives and federal steps to protect designated waters.

I think that we can anticipate other critical pieces, and it may be picked up by the national press. Cong. Bunning (R-Ky), chair of the Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee has requested information about the St. Petersburg story.	This record may be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The record appears to be a communication between two government officials discussing potential criticism of the Social Security Administration's policies regarding payments to Nazi war criminals. The discussion of potential media coverage and the need to explain the agency's policies could be considered part of the agency's decision-making process and therefore privileged. However, a FOIA requestor could argue that the public interest in transparency and accountability outweighs any potential privilege.

The text would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would be privileged in civil litigation.

It is difficult to determine whether this record would be protected under FOIA exemption 5 without additional context. Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are privileged or confidential, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. ; ; Based solely on the information provided, it is unclear whether this record falls under either of those categories. The subject matter of the record (SSA benefits and Nazi War Criminals) does not necessarily indicate that it is a privileged or confidential communication.

The loophole exists, for example, for a Nazi who flees the country without an order of deportation. Under those circumstances, SSA benefits would continue.	Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within the executive branch.

As of March 15, 1997, 18 Nazi war criminals almost (2/3) were being paid Social Security benefits. SSA found other grounds to cut off benefits to two additional Nazi war criminals, but they could return to the Social Security roles and the pay status of another one is temporarily suspended.	This information would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The information in this record does not appear to involve any privileged communication or deliberation between agencies, but rather provides factual information about the number of Nazi war criminals receiving Social Security benefits. Therefore, it would likely be subject to disclosure under FOIA.

Yes, this would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The information provided appears to be discussing internal agency policies and procedures related to the suspension of Social Security benefits for individuals convicted of certain crimes.

Explain your reasoning.; ; Thanks. cc: Diana Fortuna; ; -Other Federal Agencies Some Federal agencies that administer Federal benefit programs operate under laws that require them to suspend benefit payments to individuals while they are in prison. For example, recently enacted Welfare Reform legislation requires the Department of Agriculture to review its food stamp rolls to ensure that incarcerated individuals are not included in monthly food stamp allotments. The Department of Veterans' Affairs, in certain instances, is required to suspend payments to beneficiaries who are in jail. On the other hand, the Railroad Retirement Board, for example. does not suspend benefits to eligible individuals who are incarcerated. Many agencies, including some of those mentioned above, and the Office of Child Support Enforcement, within the Department of Health and Human Services, also need to obtain prisoner information.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, more information would be needed to determine if this exemption applies. If the information is related to ongoing legal proceedings or contains confidential advice from agency attorneys, it may be protected under exemption 5. If it is simply administrative information about agency policies and procedures, it may not be protected. Additionally, the fact that the information is being shared with another individual (Diana Fortuna) may impact whether it is considered privileged.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Thanks. cc: Diana Fortuna; ; Focus On Problems When the President took office, there was a lot of work that needed ta be done to establish an efficient and effeetlve prisoner suspension operation within the Social Security Administration. We found that many prison officials were not aware of the statutory provision requiring the suspension of Social Security and SSI payments to inmates.  In addition, there was no formal process for obtaining this Information from the facilities. Many agreements were informal, ad hoc, which made them difficult to administer and control.	No, the given text would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5. FOIA exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, the given text does not contain any such communication. It is a factual description of the problems faced by the Social Security Administration in establishing a prisoner suspension operation. It does not reveal any internal deliberations or decision-making processes. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Thanks. cc: Diana Fortuna; ; Because the facilities were not aware of the requirements, many reported only once or twice a year to SSA, often the Information was Incomplete and reported manually. The prison officials viewed the requirement as another unfunded mandate. Additionally, some correctional institutions are reluctant to enter into agreements with SSA because of the potential cost to them when Incarcerated individuals lose their Medicare or Medicaid eligibility	"It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The mention of ""unfunded mandate"" and potential costs to correctional institutions could be considered internal deliberations or policy discussions that are exempt from disclosure. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific context and content of the information."
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Thanks. cc: Diana Fortuna; ; There were serious limitations in SSA's prisoner suspension program. The internal processes were fragmented and lacked adequate controls and most tasks were manual. This resulted in the inability to stop payments to prisoners in a timely manner. Even when agreements were in place, SSA lacked a method for monitoring the facilities' compliance.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. Specifically, if the information was part of an internal agency discussion or analysis related to the prisoner suspension program, it could be considered pre-decisional and deliberative, and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, if the information has already been finalized and implemented as part of the program, it may not be protected under exemption 5. Ultimately, the determination of whether this information is exempt from disclosure would depend on the specific context and circumstances surrounding its creation and use within the agency.

Explain your reasoning.; ; Thanks. cc: Diana Fortuna; ; Moreover across the Federal govemment, there has been no consistent effort for appropriately suspending payments to incarcerated individuals or data sharing  of prisoner information among agencies. Because of the numerous Federal and State statutes that govern the redisclosure of prisoner information, Federal agencies are hindered from sharing prisoner information.	Yes, the statement would likely be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The statement discusses the lack of consistent effort and legal barriers to sharing prisoner information among federal agencies, which could be considered internal deliberations or communications related to agency decision-making. Additionally, the mention of specific statutes governing the redisclosure of prisoner information could be considered privileged legal advice. Therefore, the statement would likely be exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Thanks. cc: Diana Fortuna; ; RESULTS TO DATE Under this Administration, SSA initiated an aggressive course of action that has resulted in significant improvements in the prisoner suspension process. Over the past few years, SSA has completed a major initiative to contact and establish agreements with all correctional facilities across the United States. As a result of this, SSA has agreements with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, all State prisons and the 25 largest local jail systems to provide us prisoner data. In addition, the Agency has agreements with over 3,500 local jails. SSA has worked with Governors, heads of correctional institutions, correctional associations and similar stakeholders to obtain their help and support in providing prisoner data on a regular basis. The cooperation of State and local correctional administrators is critical to the suspension process. SSA has developed an excellent working relationship with these administrators and the associations that represent them.	It is possible that this information could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The language used in the passage suggests that the SSA has been working closely with other government agencies and stakeholders to improve their prisoner suspension process, and this information may be considered privileged or confidential. However, it ultimately depends on the specific circumstances and context of the information and whether it meets the criteria for exemption 5.
D0	D1	D1	Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning.; ; Thanks. cc: Diana Fortuna; ; As a result of these efforts, prisons and jails representing over 99 percent of the nation’s inmate population are reporting the names and Social Security numbers of incarcerated individuals to SSA. Because of our aggressive efforts to obtain information on prisoners, who are not eligible for benefits, well over 100,000 prisoners had their benefits suspended during 1995 and 1996 alone. For the period 1995-2001, our actions will result in the suspension of payments of nearly $3.5 billion. Programs such aa Social Security and Supplemental Security Income need to be protected to ensure! that only those who are eliglble for benefits are receiving them, and we are proud of the significant savings we have achieved.

There needs to be a coordinated effort within the Federal government regarding the sharing of information about incarcerated individuals. This will ensure that all provisions precluding benefits to incarcerated individuals are enforced. In addition, there needs to be a greater recognition of the medical costs associated with the prisoner population particularly those costs associated with aging and addiction.

Moreover, the Hill Dems were not happy when we did a signing ceremony with the R's on this. They hate that the R's vote against funding for virtually every other community-based drug program -- to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars -- and then turn around and support these tiny grants for community organizations.

The President's action today builds on his strong record of accomplishment in this area. In 1996, the President launched the first comprehensive effort to address the drug problem in our state criminal justice systems. President Clinton fought for and signed legislation to require states-- whose criminal justice systems house the vast majority of drug dependent offenders-- to drug test prisoners and parolees as a condition of receiving federal prison grants. Under the President's initiative, states must submit comprehensive plans of drug testing and intervention for prisoners and parolees by March 1, 1998 and implement them by September 1, 1998.

This suggests that the email contains privileged information related to the agency's decision-making process and is therefore exempt from disclosure under FOIA exemption 5.

Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are deliberative in nature and would harm the decision-making process if disclosed. However, this email does not appear to be deliberative in nature, but rather proposes a specific policy idea. Additionally, the email is not between government agencies or officials, but rather between individuals within the same agency. Therefore, this email would not be protected under exemption 5.

Drug testing (and treatment): I'll send you a chart on the success of random drug testing in the military. Use has dropped from over 25% in 1981 when the program started to 3% in 1995 -- which is one-third the civilian rate. We should find a way to help employers do this (either a handbook or a program), and come up with another proposal for the criminal justice system.	It is possible that this record could be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. The email appears to be a discussion among government officials about potential policy proposals, which could be considered part of the deliberative process. However, whether or not the email is protected would depend on the specific context and content of the communication, as well as any applicable case law.
