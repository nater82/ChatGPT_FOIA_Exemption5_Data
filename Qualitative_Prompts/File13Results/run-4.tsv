Would the following be protected under FOIA Exemption 5?; ; OPTION A: Expanding compensation to miners should be viewed in the context of the Administration's response to ACHRE more generally. In responding to ACHRE, the Administration's policy has been to be as generous as is reasonable because the government's actions in these cases denied fair protection to individuals, and undermined democratic control over the government. According to ACHRE's chair, Dr. Ruth  Faden, expanded  compensation for uranium miners is one of the most strongly-felt of ACHRE's recommendations.; ACHRE's recommendation to expand compensation without requiring individualized proof of causation is appropriate because of the egregiousness of the government's conduct, the impact  of the increased cancer rates in these communities and the government's  support for studying the miners without taking reasonable steps to reduce the known risk.; Without a change, uranium miners who are not now compensated  under RECA  will continue to be held to a higher standard of causation than others who are compensated under RECA. Under RECA, people living downwind  of certain areas are compensated  ($50,000) if they  get  a radiogenic disease--even though the probability is very low (<10%) that the disease  was caused by the government's action. In addition, because RECA is not currently based on a probabilistic standard, a significant number of uranium miners who fall within the 20%-50% probability range in Option A are already eligible for compensation.  Option  A  would overcome some of these inequities.; The Clinton Administration has, in certain cases, advocated compensation where there is less than a 50% probability that physical  harm  was caused  by  the government's  action.  First, within the last two months, the government has compensated 13 experimental subjects, as recommended by ACHRE, without any causal link to physical disease. Second, the President announced that children of veterans  exposed  to agent orange  will  be compensated  with medical care if they are born with spina bifida. This decision  was tnade despite the extremely low probability of a connection and in the absence of biological plausibility. ·; Our current best estimate of the total additional cost of this proposal  combined  with  the changes to RECA that we have already agreed upon is between $13 and $14 million over  the next 20 years. The expected cost of option A is only a fraction of this amount.; Outside of the DPC staff, this option is strongly supported by DOE. I expect that OSTP will also support this option, and OMB will express a view within the next day or so.; 	It is possible that parts of this document could be protected under FOIA Exemption 5, which covers privileged communications within or between agencies. However, it would depend on the specific context and nature of the communication. For example, if the document contains internal deliberations or recommendations that are part of the decision-making process, those portions may be exempt from disclosure. On the other hand, factual information or statements of policy may not be protected under Exemption 5. Ultimately, it would be up to the agency to determine which portions of the document are exempt from disclosure under FOIA.

FOIA Exemption 5 pertains to privileged communications within or between government agencies, such as attorney-client communications or deliberative process materials. The passage provided does not contain any such privileged communications, but rather discusses the Clinton Administration's response to ACHRE and the proposed expansion of compensation for uranium miners. Therefore, FOIA Exemption 5 does not apply in this case. There is no need to cite any case law to support this conclusion, as it is a straightforward application of the exemption.
