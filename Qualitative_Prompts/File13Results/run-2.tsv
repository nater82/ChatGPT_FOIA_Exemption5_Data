"Would the following be protected under FOIA Exemption 5?; ; We expect to announce the Administration's response to the Presidential Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments next week. As part of that announcement, the staff is recommending legislation to amend the Radiation Exposure and Compensation Act of 1990 (RECA). There is one outstanding issue with respect to the Administration's bill and,  on Friday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) asked us to seek your  view of  the change  before going ahead.; ISSUE: Should the Administration propose any compensation for uranium miners with lung cancer where the probability is between 20%-50% that their cancer was caused by government's failure to appropriately ventilate the mines?; BACKGROUND: From the 1940s to the 1960s the United States' nuclear weapons program relied on uranium from mines in the Southwestern United States. Miners working in those mines were exposed to levels of radiation known to be dangerous  because the  United States did not ensure that the mines were adequately ventilated. As a result hundreds of miners contracted or will contract fatal lung cancer.; The Radiation Exposure and Compensation  Act of 1990 (RECA)  provides  for compensation of some miners, as well as those living downwind of nuclear test  sites. Uranium  miners qualify for $100,000 compensation if they were exposed to a certain amount of radiation and they contract lung cancer (almost always fatal).; The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) recommended that the President seek legislation that would ""provide compensation to all miners who develop lung cancer after some minimal duration of employment underground..."" Their  recommendation was based, in part, on the conclusion that the actions of the United States with respect to the miners was egregious. The government knowingly allowed the miners to work under conditions likely to cause fatal cancers and neither warned the miners nor took action to mitigate the danger. See ACHRE Final Report, pages 565-582.; The Inter-Agency Working Group on Human Radiation (IAWG), chaired by DPC staff, has developed proposed legislation to respond to the ACHRE recommendations on RECA. Different aspects of the proposal would address two different populations:;     1. Miners for whom the probability is greater  than 50%  that exposure  in the mines caused their disease.  (The calculated  probability  is  population-based and does not account for individual susceptibility.) All agencies in the IAWG support proposing legislation that would affect these miners.;     2. Miners for whom the population analysis suggests that  the  probability  is less than 50% that mining exposure caused the disease. DOJ has expressed concern about proposing legislation that would compensate these miners.;     1. Miners with a Probability of Causation of Greater than 50%; The legislative history suggests that Congress intended RECA to provide compensation to uranium miners for whom the probability that their illness was caused by radiation exposure while mining is greater than 50 percent. In. these cases, RECA provides $100,000 in compensation per uranium miner. In practice, RECA does not accomplish this goal because documenting exact exposures is too difficult and because the scientific premises underlying RECA are not accurate. Therefore the current law denies compensation to some miners who clearly should be eligible.; A working group of the Department of Justice and the National Cancer Institute analyzed the current compensation scheme and recommended changes to ensure that miners are eligible for compensation if it is more likely than not (probability  >50%)  that  their  lung cancer  was caused by exposure in the mines. The proposed measures provide new, less  burdensome methods for miners to establish that radiation  caused  their illness.  The measures  also expand the list of compensable diseases, based on new scientific evidence.; All departments in the IAWG agree that the Administration should propose these changes.;     2. Miners with a Probability of Causation of Less than 50%; The AWG has also been considering a proposal to provide  partial  compensation  to miners for whom there is a significant probability that their lung cancer was caused by exposure in the mines, but the probability is less than 50%. DOJ has voiced concerns about this proposal.; OPTlONS; Option A:       Propose legislation to provide at least partial compensation ($50,000) to all miners for whom the probability is between 20% and 50% that  their  lung cancer was caused by exposure to radiation in uranium mines. This approach would also include proposing the measures outlined in Section 1, above, for miners with greater than 50% probability.; Option B:       Limit the Administration's proposed legislation to compensation of miners with lung cancer for whom it is more probable  than not that  the cancer  was caused by exposure to radiation in uranium mines (i.e. only propose  measures outlined in Section 1 above).; DISCUSSION; OPTION A: Expanding compensation to miners should be viewed in the context of the Administration's response to ACHRE more generally. In responding to ACHRE, the Administration's policy has been to be as generous as is reasonable because the government's actions in these cases denied fair protection to individuals, and undermined democratic control over the government. According to ACHRE's chair, Dr. Ruth  Faden, expanded  compensation for uranium miners is one of the most strongly-felt of ACHRE's recommendations.; ACHRE's recommendation to expand compensation without requiring individualized proof of causation is appropriate because of the egregiousness of the government's conduct, the impact  of the increased cancer rates in these communities and the government's  support for studying the miners without taking reasonable steps to reduce the known risk.; Without a change, uranium miners who are not now compensated  under RECA  will continue to be held to a higher standard of causation than others who are compensated under RECA. Under RECA, people living downwind  of certain areas are compensated  ($50,000) if they  get  a radiogenic disease--even though the probability is very low (<10%) that the disease  was caused by the government's action. In addition, because RECA is not currently based on a probabilistic standard, a significant number of uranium miners who fall within the 20%-50% probability range in Option A are already eligible for compensation.  Option  A  would overcome some of these inequities.; The Clinton Administration has, in certain cases, advocated compensation where there is less than a 50% probability that physical  harm  was caused  by  the government's  action.  First, within the last two months, the government has compensated 13 experimental subjects, as recommended by ACHRE, without any causal link to physical disease.

The expected cost of option A is only a fraction of this amount.; Outside of the DPC staff, this option is strongly supported by DOE. I expect that OSTP will also support this option, and OMB will express a view within the next day or so.; OPTION B: (A memo from DOJ making a full argument on this point is attached.]; The general rule in litigation should remain that the government will only pay compensation if it is more likely than not that the government's action caused the harm. Any  decision  to expand the government's liability to other cases is setting a bad precedent. The possible result will be further expansion of the government's liability within RECA--possibly to new populations--and the creation of a model that may be used in entirely different circumstances.; This option is supported by DOJ.; PUBLIC REACTION: Stuart Udall, former Secretary of the Interior and his clients, mostly Navaho, are likely to react strongly if  the  Administration does not  propose  some compensation for most miners with lung cancer. I expect they will have some success in the New Mexico Congressional Delegation and with the Governor. The decision on this issue, however, is unlikely to affect the overall reception of the Administration's response  to ACHRE.; RECOMMENDATION AND NEXT STEPS; I recommend that you support Option A.

"It is not clear whether the text below consists of deliberative material or factual material for purposes of being protected under FOIA Exemption 5.  What do you think, and cite any case law that supports your conclusion either way.; ; We expect to announce the Administration's response to the Presidential Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments next week. As part of that announcement, the staff is recommending legislation to amend the Radiation Exposure and Compensation Act of 1990 (RECA). There is one outstanding issue with respect to the Administration's bill and,  on Friday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) asked us to seek your  view of  the change  before going ahead.; ISSUE: Should the Administration propose any compensation for uranium miners with lung cancer where the probability is between 20%-50% that their cancer was caused by government's failure to appropriately ventilate the mines?; BACKGROUND: From the 1940s to the 1960s the United States' nuclear weapons program relied on uranium from mines in the Southwestern United States. Miners working in those mines were exposed to levels of radiation known to be dangerous  because the  United States did not ensure that the mines were adequately ventilated. As a result hundreds of miners contracted or will contract fatal lung cancer.; The Radiation Exposure and Compensation  Act of 1990 (RECA)  provides  for compensation of some miners, as well as those living downwind of nuclear test  sites. Uranium  miners qualify for $100,000 compensation if they were exposed to a certain amount of radiation and they contract lung cancer (almost always fatal).; The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (ACHRE) recommended that the President seek legislation that would ""provide compensation to all miners who develop lung cancer after some minimal duration of employment underground..."" Their  recommendation was based, in part, on the conclusion that the actions of the United States with respect to the miners was egregious. The government knowingly allowed the miners to work under conditions likely to cause fatal cancers and neither warned the miners nor took action to mitigate the danger. See ACHRE Final Report, pages 565-582.; The Inter-Agency Working Group on Human Radiation (IAWG), chaired by DPC staff, has developed proposed legislation to respond to the ACHRE recommendations on RECA. Different aspects of the proposal would address two different populations:;     1. Miners for whom the probability is greater  than 50%  that exposure  in the mines caused their disease.  (The calculated  probability  is  population-based and does not account for individual susceptibility.) All agencies in the IAWG support proposing legislation that would affect these miners.;     2. Miners for whom the population analysis suggests that  the  probability  is less than 50% that mining exposure caused the disease. DOJ has expressed concern about proposing legislation that would compensate these miners.;     1. Miners with a Probability of Causation of Greater than 50%; The legislative history suggests that Congress intended RECA to provide compensation to uranium miners for whom the probability that their illness was caused by radiation exposure while mining is greater than 50 percent. In. these cases, RECA provides $100,000 in compensation per uranium miner. In practice, RECA does not accomplish this goal because documenting exact exposures is too difficult and because the scientific premises underlying RECA are not accurate. Therefore the current law denies compensation to some miners who clearly should be eligible.; A working group of the Department of Justice and the National Cancer Institute analyzed the current compensation scheme and recommended changes to ensure that miners are eligible for compensation if it is more likely than not (probability  >50%)  that  their  lung cancer  was caused by exposure in the mines. The proposed measures provide new, less  burdensome methods for miners to establish that radiation  caused  their illness.  The measures  also expand the list of compensable diseases, based on new scientific evidence.; All departments in the IAWG agree that the Administration should propose these changes.;     2. Miners with a Probability of Causation of Less than 50%; The AWG has also been considering a proposal to provide  partial  compensation  to miners for whom there is a significant probability that their lung cancer was caused by exposure in the mines, but the probability is less than 50%. DOJ has voiced concerns about this proposal.; OPTlONS; Option A:       Propose legislation to provide at least partial compensation ($50,000) to all miners for whom the probability is between 20% and 50% that  their  lung cancer was caused by exposure to radiation in uranium mines. This approach would also include proposing the measures outlined in Section 1, above, for miners with greater than 50% probability.; Option B:       Limit the Administration's proposed legislation to compensation of miners with lung cancer for whom it is more probable  than not that  the cancer  was caused by exposure to radiation in uranium mines (i.e. only propose  measures outlined in Section 1 above).; DISCUSSION; OPTION A: Expanding compensation to miners should be viewed in the context of the Administration's response to ACHRE more generally. In responding to ACHRE, the Administration's policy has been to be as generous as is reasonable because the government's actions in these cases denied fair protection to individuals, and undermined democratic control over the government. According to ACHRE's chair, Dr. Ruth  Faden, expanded  compensation for uranium miners is one of the most strongly-felt of ACHRE's recommendations.; ACHRE's recommendation to expand compensation without requiring individualized proof of causation is appropriate because of the egregiousness of the government's conduct, the impact  of the increased cancer rates in these communities and the government's  support for studying the miners without taking reasonable steps to reduce the known risk.; Without a change, uranium miners who are not now compensated  under RECA  will continue to be held to a higher standard of causation than others who are compensated under RECA. Under RECA, people living downwind  of certain areas are compensated  ($50,000) if they  get  a radiogenic disease--even though the probability is very low (<10%) that the disease  was caused by the government's action. In addition, because RECA is not currently based on a probabilistic standard, a significant number of uranium miners who fall within the 20%-50% probability range in Option A are already eligible for compensation.  Option  A  would overcome some of these inequities.; The Clinton Administration has, in certain cases, advocated compensation where there is less than a 50% probability that physical  harm  was caused  by  the government's  action.  First, within the last two months, the government has compensated 13 experimental subjects, as recommended by ACHRE, without any causal link to physical disease. Second, the President announced that children of veterans  exposed  to agent orange  will  be compensated  with medical care if they are born with spina bifida. This decision  was tnade despite the extremely low probability of a connection and in the absence of biological plausibility. Â·; Our current best estimate of the total additional cost of this proposal  combined  with  the changes to RECA that we have already agreed upon is between $13 and $14 million over  the next 20 years.
