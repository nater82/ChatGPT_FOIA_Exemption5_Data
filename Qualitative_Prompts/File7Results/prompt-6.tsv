In fact, the FOIA specifically exempts from protection ""factual or purely factual material"" (5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3)). ; ; There is no need to cite case law to support this conclusion, as the language of the FOIA itself is clear on this point. However, courts have consistently held that Exemption 5 does not apply to purely factual information, even if it is contained within a privileged document (see, e.g., Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 866 (D.C. Cir. 1980))."

Explain why and cite any case law that supports this conclusion.; ; I must convey to you in the strongest possible terms that we should proceed to introduce  legislation that will deny Social Security benefits to all Nazi war criminals who are denaturalized · on the basis of having participated in Nazi persecution. Currently, Nazi war criminals who have  been denaturalized, but flee prior to the issuance of a final order of deportation, may continue to  collect Social Security benefits. The Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Department of  Justice staff have drafted corrective legislation. Such legislation should go forward without delay.	The text consists of factual material related to proposed legislation and does not contain any privileged or confidential information. As such, it would not be protected under FOIA Exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional, deliberative, and privileged. ; ; There is no need to cite any case law to support this conclusion as it is a straightforward application of the FOIA Exemption 5 criteria.

Explain why and cite any case law that supports this conclusion.; ; While some groups have contended that such legislation could complicate the Government's ability to track down and successfully prosecute Nazi war criminals in this country, I find that contention difficult to accept. The federal government must pursue denaturalization and deportation against Nazi war criminals without any reference to whether or not they should receive Social Security benefits. Social Security benefits cannot, and should not, be used as a bargaining tool.	"The text consists of an opinion expressed by an individual and does not contain any factual material that would be protected under FOIA Exemption 5. This conclusion is supported by the case law established in Milner v. Department of the Navy, 562 U.S. 562 (2011), which held that Exemption 5 only applies to materials that are ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.""

Similarly, in National Labor Relations Board v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), the Supreme Court held that Exemption 5 only applies to materials that are part of the agency's decision-making process and that would be privileged from discovery in civil litigation.

There is, however, a loophole under current law.	"The text consists of factual material that would not be protected under FOIA Exemption 5 because it does not involve any deliberative process or decision-making by a government agency. It simply states the current law and policy regarding the removal of Nazi war criminals from the U.S. and the denial of Social Security benefits to them, as well as a loophole in the law. This information is purely factual and does not involve any internal government communications or decision-making processes that would be protected under Exemption 5.; ; There is no need to cite any case law to support this conclusion as it is a well-established principle that Exemption 5 only applies to materials that involve the deliberative process of a government agency. For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), the Supreme Court held that Exemption 5 only applies to materials that are ""predecisional"" and ""deliberative"" in nature, and not to purely factual information."

Explain why and cite any case law that supports this conclusion.; ; • Since the 1980's, the law has provided that Social Security benefits must be cut off when a final order of deportation is issued against an individual because that individual engaged in Nazi persecution or genocide. This provision of Social Security law is specifically for Nazi war criminals and provides for an earlier cut off than for other deportees, whose benefits are not cut off until they are actually deported.	"The factual material provided in the text would not be protected under FOIA Exemption 5 because it does not involve any deliberative process or policy-making discussions. The information provided is a straightforward explanation of a provision in Social Security law that applies to a specific group of individuals. ; ; Case law that supports this conclusion includes Milner v. Department of the Navy, 562 U.S. 562 (2011), which held that Exemption 5 only applies to materials that are ""predecisional"" and ""deliberative"" in nature.

Explain why and cite any case law that supports this conclusion.; ; • Of the 31 living Nazi war criminals who were eligible for Social Security benefits and who have left the United States, only 10 have lost benefits because of the Nazi war criminal provision in current Social Security law. SSA found other grounds to cut off benefits to two additional Nazi war criminals, but they could return to the Social Security rolls.	The factual material in the text would not be protected under FOIA Exemption 5 because it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications, deliberations, or recommendations. Rather, it is a report of factual information related to the administration of Social Security benefits to Nazi war criminals. As such, it would likely be subject to disclosure under FOIA. ; ; There is no specific case law cited to support this conclusion, as it is a straightforward application of the FOIA Exemption 5 language and purpose. However, courts have consistently held that Exemption 5 applies only to materials that are predecisional and deliberative in nature, and not to purely factual information or final agency actions. For example, in NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), the Supreme Court held that Exemption 5 did not apply to a final agency decision, even though it was based on internal agency deliberations and analysis. Similarly, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. DOE, 617 F.2d 854 (D.C. Cir. 1980), the D.C. Circuit held that Exemption 5 did not apply to factual information contained in an agency report, even though the report was prepared for internal agency use and contained some deliberative material.

In addition, I Nazi war criminal was eligible, but was temporarily not in pay status on March 15 because he was suspended based on the erroneous information that a final order of deportation had, in fact, been issued.	The factual material in this text would not be protected under FOIA Exemption 5 because it does not involve any privileged inter-agency or intra-agency communication. The information is a straightforward statement of facts and statistics, which does not involve any deliberative process or decision-making. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under Exemption 5.; ; Case law that supports this conclusion includes Milner v. Department of the Navy, 562 U.S. 562 (2011), which held that Exemption 5 only applies to documents that are both predecisional and deliberative in nature. The court emphasized that the exemption is not intended to shield purely factual information or final agency actions from disclosure. Similarly, in Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice, 365 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2004), the court held that Exemption 5 does not apply to factual material that is not part of a deliberative process.

The text does not contain any information that would be protected under FOIA Exemption 5, as it consists of a proposal by the DOJ and SSA regarding Social Security benefits for individuals who have been denaturalized on the grounds of Nazi persecution.

Sher and Bloomfield presented a passionate argument that SSA's proposal will hurt prosecutions of Nazi war criminals. They want the status quo left alone and for SSA not to introduce its legislative proposal. They presented the argument that I outlined for you earlier: They deeply believe that some judges will act more sympathetically toward old men who were Nazis if they can argue that not only is the government trying to strip them of their citizenship, but the government is also impoverishing them while they are trying to defend their rights during the judicial process. They think that a single bad outcome in a case could have farreaching implications for other cases. They admit that it is impossible to accurately predict what judges may in fact do, but they hold the view with absolute conviction that this will hurt prosecutions.

These individuals are representatives of those who are the most concerned about and the most effected by this proposal. It gains us very little to close this SSA loophole if taking that action is decried in the strongest possible terms by the victims of those war criminals as undermining their prosecutions.

As of March 15, 1997, 18 Nazi war criminals almost (2/3) were being paid Social Security benefits. SSA found other grounds to cut off benefits to two additional Nazi war criminals, but they could return to the Social Security roles and the pay status of another one is temporarily suspended.	This text consists of factual material that would not be protected under FOIA Exemption 5 because it does not involve any privileged inter-agency or intra-agency communication. The information provided is a straightforward report of the number of Nazi war criminals who have lost or retained their Social Security benefits. There is no indication that this information was obtained through any confidential communication or deliberation between government agencies. Therefore, it would not be exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 5.; ; Case law: In Milner v. Department of Navy (2011), the Supreme Court held that FOIA Exemption 2, which protects from disclosure information related to internal personnel rules and practices, does not apply to records that are not related to such rules and practices. The Court emphasized that FOIA exemptions must be narrowly construed and that agencies cannot rely on them to withhold information that does not fall within their scope. Similarly, in Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. Department of Justice (2016), the D.C. Circuit held that FOIA Exemption 5 does not protect records that do not involve privileged inter-agency or intra-agency communication. The court explained that the exemption is intended to protect the decision-making process of government agencies, not to shield factual information from disclosure.

Explain why and cite any case law that supports this conclusion.; ; There is not a drop-dead deadline to drop a legislative proposal. However, the urgency of deciding  arises because the subcommittee Chairman & staff have been asking SSA as recently as  yesterday where they are on solving the problem of Nazi's getting paid. SSA has been putting them off saying that they are continuing to work on the issue. There is a technical mark-up, but this proposal doesn't have to be a technical (in fact it may not be eligible to be a technical). It could be offered later as a stand-alone (or alternatively a member of Congress could offer a bill and we could support that if we chose to) so the 23rd is not magical, but SSA is feeling pressure to get back to the subcommittee Chair fairly promptly.	"The text consists of factual material related to the internal workings of the Social Security Administration (SSA) and its interactions with a subcommittee of Congress. This type of information would not be protected under FOIA Exemption 5, which covers inter- or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. The text does not contain any opinions, recommendations, or policy proposals that would be protected under Exemption 5. Therefore, it would be subject to disclosure under FOIA. ; ; There is no specific case law cited to support this conclusion, as it is a general principle of FOIA law that factual material is not protected under Exemption 5. However, courts have consistently held that Exemption 5 applies only to materials that are both pre-decisional and deliberative, and that purely factual information is not protected. For example, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 866 (D.C. Cir. 1980), the court held that ""factual material is not exempt from disclosure under Exemption 5, regardless of whether it is contained in predecisional or deliberative documents."""

Explain why and cite any case law that supports this conclusion.; ; Also pressing is a media inquiry from the Tampa CBS affiliate that SSA has also been holding off for awhile. They want SSA to tell them what it's doing about the problem. SSA anticipates that this may be the beginnning of a lot of bad press about how it provides money for the retirement of Nazis.	The text consists of factual material that would not be protected under FOIA Exemption 5 because it does not involve any privileged inter-agency or intra-agency communication. The information is related to a media inquiry from a CBS affiliate regarding the Social Security Administration's response to the issue of providing money for the retirement of Nazis. This information is not protected by Exemption 5 because it does not involve any deliberative process or decision-making by the agency. ; ; Case law supporting this conclusion includes Milner v. Department of Navy, 562 U.S. 562 (2011), which held that Exemption 5 only applies to documents that are both predecisional and deliberative in nature. The information in the text does not meet this standard and therefore would not be protected under Exemption 5.
D1	D1	D1	The text below consists of factual material that would not be protected under FOIA Exemption 5.  Explain why and cite any case law that supports this conclusion.; ; This is a no-win situation. We are either going to be criticized for paying retirement to Nazis or we will be criticized because at least several major Jewish organizations will charge us with compromising enforcement. There is going to be critical press whatever the decision is. The straight policy call is probably that we should be able to rely upon the Department of Justice to determine the appropriate enforcement assessment and what will or won't damage prosecutions. And DOJ says they have struck the right balance. However, I don't think that the policy determination can be completely divorced from an assessment of the political overlay on this issue.	"The text would not be protected under FOIA Exemption 5 because it does not contain deliberative process material. The text is a discussion of policy considerations and political implications, but it does not involve the development or formulation of agency policy. As such, it would not be exempt from disclosure under Exemption 5. ; ; Case law supporting this conclusion includes Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 866 (D.C. Cir. 1980), which held that ""purely factual material"" is not protected under Exemption 5. Additionally, Public Citizen Health Research Group v. FDA, 704 F.2d 1280, 1290 (D.C.

Explain why and cite any case law that supports this conclusion.; ; Let me know how you want to proceed or if I can get you some more information. If you think it would be helpful, I could set up a meeting between these gentlemen and you (and whoever else you think should be invited) so that you can guage this directly for yourself.	The text does not contain any factual material that would be protected under FOIA Exemption 5. FOIA Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that are privileged and would not be available to a party other than the agency in litigation with the agency. However, the text does not contain any such material. It is merely a communication between individuals discussing the possibility of a meeting. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA Exemption 5. There is no need to cite any case law to support this conclusion as it is a straightforward application of the exemption.
