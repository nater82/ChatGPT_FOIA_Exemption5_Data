D0	D1	D1	"Would the following be protected under FOIA exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any recent case law that supports your conclusion.; ; Obviously, everyone in attendance agreed that we shared the objective of not wanting to do anything to compromise prosecutions of Nazis. SSA and DOJ explained how they engaged in interagency discussions to reach what they jointly view as a proposal that properly balances SSA's concern about ``subsidizing the retirement of Nazis'' with enforcement concerns. It is important to note that DOJ concedes that there remains some possible enforcement implications, but again, they believe that this proposal is an appropriate balancing of policy objectives.; ; In my follow-up with the White House attendees at the meeting, we agree that the specific enforcement concern depends on predictions on what judges may or may not do and therefore does not sound fully compelling EXCEPT that it is impossible to ignore who is raising the concern. These individuals are representatives of those who are the most concerned about and the most effected by this proposal.	It gains us very little to close this SSA loophole if taking that action is decried in the strongest possible terms by the victims of those war criminals as undermining their prosecutions.; ; And make no mistake, Messrs. Sher and Bloomfield were absolutely clear that they and their organizations would protest vociforously [sic]. They would protest in the media, and they would protest in Congress. They would make sure that it is known that the President has introduced legislation that would compromise the prosecutions of Nazis."	The passage would not be protected under FOIA exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. The passage does not appear to be a communication between agencies or within an agency, nor does it appear to be pre-decisional or deliberative in nature. Rather, it appears to be a summary of a meeting and the views expressed by various attendees. ; ; Recent case law that supports this conclusion includes Milner v. Department of the Navy (2011), in which the Supreme Court held that FOIA exemption 5 does not apply to documents that are not pre-decisional or deliberative in nature, even if they are inter-agency or intra-agency communications. Additionally, in Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. Department of Justice (2016), the D.C. Circuit held that a document that merely summarizes a meeting and does not contain any pre-decisional or deliberative information is not protected under FOIA exemption 5.
