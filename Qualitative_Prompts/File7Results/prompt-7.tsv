What do you think, and cite any case law that supports your conclusion either way.; ; I must convey to you in the strongest possible terms that we should proceed to introduce  legislation that will deny Social Security benefits to all Nazi war criminals who are denaturalized Â· on the basis of having participated in Nazi persecution. Currently, Nazi war criminals who have  been denaturalized, but flee prior to the issuance of a final order of deportation, may continue to  collect Social Security benefits. The Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Department of  Justice staff have drafted corrective legislation. Such legislation should go forward without delay.	"Based on the language used in the text, it appears to be deliberative material rather than factual material. The text is advocating for a specific course of action (introducing legislation) and expressing a strong opinion on the matter. This type of material is typically protected under FOIA Exemption 5, which covers inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that Exemption 5 covers ""documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated."" The text in question appears to fall within this category, as it reflects a recommendation and deliberation on a policy matter."

What do you think, and cite any case law that supports your conclusion either way.; ; While some groups have contended that such legislation could complicate the Government's ability to track down and successfully prosecute Nazi war criminals in this country, I find that contention difficult to accept. The federal government must pursue denaturalization and deportation against Nazi war criminals without any reference to whether or not they should receive Social Security benefits. Social Security benefits cannot, and should not, be used as a bargaining tool.	"The text appears to be deliberative material because it expresses an opinion and a policy preference. It is not simply a recitation of facts. The author is advocating for a particular approach to handling Nazi war criminals and expressing a belief about the role of Social Security benefits in that process. ; ; Case law that supports this conclusion includes Milner v. Department of the Navy, 562 U.S. 562 (2011), which held that Exemption 5 protects only materials that are both predecisional and deliberative. The court explained that ""predecisional"" means ""generated before the adoption of an agency policy"" and ""deliberative"" means ""reflective of the give-and-take of the consultative process."" Here, the text is clearly reflective of the author's thought process and is not simply a statement of established policy or fact."

D0	D1	D1	It is not clear whether the text below consists of deliberative material or factual material for purposes of being protected under FOIA Exemption 5.  What do you think, and cite any case law that supports your conclusion either way.; ; â¢ Since the 1980's, the law has provided that Social Security benefits must be cut off when a final order of deportation is issued against an individual because that individual engaged in Nazi persecution or genocide. This provision of Social Security law is specifically for Nazi war criminals and provides for an earlier cut off than for other deportees, whose benefits are not cut off until they are actually deported.	The text below consists of factual material for purposes of being protected under FOIA Exemption 5. This is because it provides information about a specific provision of Social Security law and how it applies to individuals who engaged in Nazi persecution or genocide. This information is not subject to deliberation or policy-making, but rather is a statement of existing law and its application. ; ; There is no case law cited to support this conclusion, as it is a straightforward application of the distinction between factual and deliberative material under FOIA Exemption 5.

SSA found other grounds to cut off benefits to two additional Nazi war criminals, but they could return to the Social Security rolls.	"The text appears to consist of factual material rather than deliberative material for purposes of being protected under FOIA Exemption 5. The text simply presents information about the number of Nazi war criminals who have lost Social Security benefits and the reasons for their loss of benefits. This information does not involve any policy-making or decision-making processes that would be protected under Exemption 5. ; ; There is no specific case law cited to support this conclusion, as it is a general principle that factual material is not protected under Exemption 5. However, the Supreme Court has held that Exemption 5 applies to ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" (NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 150 (1975)).

What do you think, and cite any case law that supports your conclusion either way.; ; â¢ As of March 15, 1997, 18 Nazi war criminals (almost 2/3) were being paid Social Security benefits. In addition, I Nazi war criminal was eligible, but was temporarily not in pay status on March 15 because he was suspended based on the erroneous information that a final order of deportation had, in fact, been issued.	Based on the information provided, it appears that the text consists of factual material rather than deliberative material. The text simply presents information about the number of Nazi war criminals receiving Social Security benefits as of a specific date, and does not appear to involve any policy recommendations or decision-making processes. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA Exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law cited to support this conclusion, as the determination of whether material is deliberative or factual is highly fact-specific and depends on the context in which the information was created and used. However, courts have generally held that factual material is not protected under Exemption 5, while deliberative material (such as internal memos or recommendations) may be protected if it reflects the agency's decision-making process.

"The text appears to consist of factual material rather than deliberative material for purposes of being protected under FOIA Exemption 5.

This is an earlier point in time than under current law. This proposal would cut off benefits of those who leave the U.S. before an order of deportation is issued, as well as those who attempt to stay in the U.S. by fighting an order of deportation.	"The text appears to be deliberative material because it is a proposal put forth by the DOJ and SSA. It is not a statement of fact or a record of an event that has occurred.

Sher and Bloomfield presented a passionate argument that SSA's proposal will hurt prosecutions of Nazi war criminals. They want the status quo left alone and for SSA not to introduce its legislative proposal. They presented the argument that I outlined for you earlier: They deeply believe that some judges will act more sympathetically toward old men who were Nazis if they can argue that not only is the government trying to strip them of their citizenship, but the government is also impoverishing them while they are trying to defend their rights during the judicial process. They think that a single bad outcome in a case could have farreaching implications for other cases. They admit that it is impossible to accurately predict what judges may in fact do, but they hold the view with absolute conviction that this will hurt prosecutions.

What do you think, and cite any case law that supports your conclusion either way.; ; BACKGROUND: The current law is that SSA benefits must be cut off when a final order of deportation is issued against an individual becuase that individual engaged in Nazi persecution or genocide.  The loophole exists, for example, for a Nazi who flees the country without an order of deportation. Under those circumstances, SSA benefits would continue.	"Based on the information provided, it appears that the text consists of factual material rather than deliberative material. The text simply describes the current law and a loophole in that law. It does not appear to involve any policy recommendations or decision-making processes. Therefore, it would not be protected under FOIA Exemption 5.; ; There is no specific case law cited to support this conclusion, but it is generally understood that factual material is not protected under Exemption 5. For example, in Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v. U.S. Forest Serv., 861 F.2d 1114, 1118 (9th Cir. 1988), the court held that ""factual material is not protected by the deliberative process privilege."""

What do you think, and cite any case law that supports your conclusion either way.; ; Of the 31 living Nazi war criminal who were eligible for benefits and who have left the United  States, only 10 have lost benefits because of the Nazi war criminal provision in current Social Security law. As of March 15, 1997, 18 Nazi war criminals almost (2/3) were being paid Social Security benefits. SSA found other grounds to cut off benefits to two additional Nazi war criminals, but they could return to the Social Security roles and the pay status of another one is temporarily suspended.	"I believe that the text consists of factual material and is not protected under FOIA Exemption 5. The text simply presents statistics and information about the number of Nazi war criminals who have lost or retained their Social Security benefits. There is no indication that the text contains any deliberative or policy-making material that would be exempt from disclosure under Exemption 5.; ; Case law supports this conclusion. In Milner v. Department of the Navy (2011), the Supreme Court held that Exemption 5 only applies to materials that are ""predecisional"" and ""deliberative"" in nature, meaning that they were created before a final decision was made and contain opinions, recommendations, or other materials that reflect the agency's decision-making process. Factual information, on the other hand, is not protected under Exemption 5 and must be disclosed under FOIA."

However, the urgency of deciding  arises because the subcommittee Chairman & staff have been asking SSA as recently as  yesterday where they are on solving the problem of Nazi's getting paid. SSA has been putting them off saying that they are continuing to work on the issue. There is a technical mark-up, but this proposal doesn't have to be a technical (in fact it may not be eligible to be a technical). It could be offered later as a stand-alone (or alternatively a member of Congress could offer a bill and we could support that if we chose to) so the 23rd is not magical, but SSA is feeling pressure to get back to the subcommittee Chair fairly promptly.	"The text appears to be deliberative material because it discusses the urgency of deciding on a legislative proposal and the pressure that SSA is feeling to respond to the subcommittee Chairman's inquiries.

They want SSA to tell them what it's doing about the problem. SSA anticipates that this may be the beginnning of a lot of bad press about how it provides money for the retirement of Nazis.	"Based on the language used, it appears that the text consists of deliberative material rather than factual material.

We are either going to be criticized for paying retirement to Nazis or we will be criticized because at least several major Jewish organizations will charge us with compromising enforcement. There is going to be critical press whatever the decision is. The straight policy call is probably that we should be able to rely upon the Department of Justice to determine the appropriate enforcement assessment and what will or won't damage prosecutions. And DOJ says they have struck the right balance. However, I don't think that the policy determination can be completely divorced from an assessment of the political overlay on this issue.
