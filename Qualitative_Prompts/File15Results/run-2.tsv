The document appears to contain internal communications between government officials discussing strategy and negotiations related to a policy issue. The fact that the officials are discussing their opposition to a specific policy proposal and their plans to meet with the President and congressional leadership suggests that the information is part of the deliberative process and therefore exempt from disclosure under Exemption 5.; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975), in which the Supreme Court held that Exemption 5 protects ""documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated."" The Court explained that the exemption is intended to protect the ""decision-making processes of government agencies"" by allowing officials to engage in frank and open discussions without fear of public disclosure. The information in this document appears to fall within this category of protected material."
