(5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5)). The text contains internal communications between government officials discussing strategy and potential responses to a request from the National Governors Association regarding Medicaid policy. The discussions involve the potential impact of the policy on children's health and the opposition of certain governors and Democrats to the proposed policy. The text also includes opinions and recommendations regarding how to respond to the request. This type of material is protected under Exemption 5 because it is part of the decision-making process and disclosure could harm the agency's ability to make informed decisions. The case law supporting this conclusion includes NLRB v.

The record appears to be a factual account of a request for a meeting and the purpose of that meeting, rather than a discussion of policy options or recommendations. There is no indication that the record reflects the agency's decision-making process or contains any recommendations or opinions that are part of that process.

FOIA Exemption 5 protects inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are part of the decision-making process, and that would not be available to a party outside of the government. The email in question is discussing a meeting request from the National Governors Association regarding Medicaid policy and budget negotiations. There is no indication that the email contains any information related to national security or foreign policy that would fall under Exemption 5. Therefore, case law related to Exemption 5 and national security, such as Department of the Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352 (1976), is not applicable in this case.
