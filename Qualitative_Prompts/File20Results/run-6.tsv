Wants  EPA  to finalize  its rule in August, to provide certainty to permit applicants.;     • Pallone-Torricelli:   Want closure of MDS after an additional 300,000 cubic yards of category 2, or alternatively after category 2 capacity needs  have  been  met  through 1997.   Want  EPA  to postpone  its rule indefinitely.    In offering these proposals, Torricelli and Pallone are negotiating, in part, on behalf of the environmental groups whose support they  need  in  the  corning  elections.

The fact that the authors consulted with EPA and OMB and that they agree with the recommendation could suggest that this is a privileged communication. However, it would ultimately depend on the specific circumstances and the agency's determination.

The passage describes internal deliberations and recommendations made by agency officials after consulting with other agencies and outside stakeholders. The passage also references ongoing negotiations and political considerations, which could be considered part of the agency's decision-making process. ; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1978), in which the Supreme Court held that Exemption 5 covers ""intra-agency memorandums which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" The Court noted that the exemption is intended to protect the ""decision-making processes of government agencies"" and that it applies to ""materials that would reveal the deliberative process by which government decisions are made."" ; ; Another relevant case is Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy (1979), in which the D.C. Circuit held that Exemption 5 covers ""predecisional communications among agency personnel, and between agency personnel and outside consultants, that reflect the give-and-take of the consultative process."" The court emphasized that the exemption is intended to protect the ""quality of agency decisions"" by allowing officials to freely exchange ideas and opinions without fear of public disclosure. ; ; Overall, the passage appears to fall within the scope of Exemption 5 because it reflects internal deliberations and recommendations made by agency officials in consultation with other agencies and outside stakeholders. The passage also contains references to ongoing negotiations and political considerations, which could be considered part of the agency's decision-making process."

It is simply a summary of discussions and recommendations made by government officials and agencies regarding a proposed initiative. There is no indication that the information is deliberative or pre-decisional in nature, which are the types of materials that are typically protected under Exemption 5. ; ; Case law that supports this conclusion includes Milner v. Department of the Navy (2011), in which the Supreme Court held that Exemption 5 only applies to materials that are both pre-decisional and deliberative in nature. The Court emphasized that the exemption is not intended to shield purely factual information or final agency actions from disclosure. Similarly, in Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Justice (2016), the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals held that Exemption 5 does not protect factual summaries of meetings or discussions that do not reveal the agency's decision-making process.

FOIA Exemption 5 pertains to the withholding of inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. The information provided in the prompt does not fall under this category and therefore is not protected under FOIA Exemption 5. There is no case law cited in the prompt to support this conclusion.
