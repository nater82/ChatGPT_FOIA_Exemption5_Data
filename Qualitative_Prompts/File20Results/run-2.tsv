"Would the following be protected under FOIA Exemption 5?; ; We have discussed the draft ""Healthy Port Initiative"" with labor unions; port operators and shipping interests; moderate environmentalists; Representatives Menendez, Pallone, and Torricelli; and Senator Lautenberg's  staff.  Below  is a summary  of the  remaining  issues and our recommended next steps. We have consulted with EPA and OMB in making our recommendation, and they agree.; Summary; While there is consensus on most elements of the initiative, there remains  a  sharp  divide between Rep. Menendez Goined by the ports and the unions), and Congressmen Pallone and Torricelli Goined by environmental  groups  and  possibly  Governor  Whitman)  over  two central issues:;     • The Mud Dump Site (MDS): A dredge  material  disposal  site offshore  but  near Pallone's district. Federal law and policy now allows  disposal  of  category  I  and category 2 dredge material  at  this site.  (Category  I  is clean;  category  2 passes  tests but has some contamination; category 3 is not suitable for disposal in the ocean.) Governor Whitman has pledged not  to  put category  2 in  the  ocean,  and  that  pledge has been strongly endorsed by environmental groups and  shore  newspapers,  but there  are very few alternatives for category 2 disposal in the short  term.  Our  initiative proposed a decision by January 31, 1997 concerning the phase out of the Mud Dump Site, with the consideration of the alternatives for disposal.;     • The EPA testing rule. This is a proposed rule revising  the regulations  governing how and when to test for contamination  in dredge material.    A New Jersey federal court opinion argues that EPA's technical manuals conflict with its underlying regulation -- rendering permits legally vulnerable. Environmentalists have derided EPA's rule as a ""rollback""  of ocean protection. Unions and port operators want the rule finalized as soon as possible, believing the rule change essential if permits to dispose material at the MDS are to survive court challenges. Our initiative proposed EPA action on the rule by August 1, I 996.; Positions;     • Menendez: Wants continued use of the MD.S  for both category  I  and  2 material,  and continued ocean disposal of category 2 generally.  Wants  EPA  to finalize  its rule in August, to provide certainty to permit applicants.;     • Pallone-Torricelli:   Want closure of MDS after an additional 300,000 cubic yards of category 2, or alternatively after category 2 capacity needs  have  been  met  through 1997.   Want  EPA  to postpone  its rule indefinitely.    In offering these proposals, Torricelli and Pallone are negotiating, in part, on behalf of the environmental groups whose support they  need  in  the  corning  elections.  (Representative  Zimmer, Torriceili's opponent in  the current  Senate  race,  reportedly  has  prepared advertisements castigating Torricelli for supporting ocean dumping.); Recommendation; We recommend that the Administration make a counter-proposal to Pallone and  Torricelli, with the following elements:;     • We would immediately begin  administrative  action  to close  the MDS  to category  2 at the end I997. This action would require a public proposal (this summer), a comment period, and a final  decision  (early  I997).  We  would  make  the  proposal and indicate our intention to close the  site,  but  would  not  pre-judge  the  final outcome of this process.;     • We would insist that the MDS be available as necessary until the end of 1997 for disposal of category 1 and 2 material. This  may  require  an  increase  in elevation  at the site.;     • We would agree to delay the EPA rule until  all of the issues  have  been  discussed with environmentalists and other stakeholders, including a process to  examine scientific issues related to the rule. We anticipate  that  this  process  will  take  six to ten months.;     • We would require, as a condition of these  commitments,  that  key  environmental groups agree to not challenge permits to dispose of category I and 2 material  at  the MDS (using the existing testing rule) until the end of I997.; Pros: This proposal is very close to that outlined by Pallone and Torricelli,  except  that we would use an appropriate administrative process  to  decide  on  closure  of  the  MDS  rather than announcing closure by fiat, and we  would  reject  the strict  volume  limitation  they propose in the interim. We would expect  that this will  disarm  environmental  criticism  and help move short-term dredging, but we would  want  to  elicit  an  understanding  with  New York and New Jersey that they will not be criticize short-term use of the MDS.; Cons: It will be difficult to convince  Representative  Menendez  that  this  approach  makes sense. Our position will be that  this  approach  will  accomplish  what  he  needs  by  ensuring that dredging can go on for the next year, while allowing  continued  use of the  MDS  for the very short term: In addition it will allow the EPA rule issues to  be  resolved  in  a  less contentious climate, after  further  work  with  affected  interests,  thereby  reducing  the likelihood  of  litigation  over  the rule itself.    We will need to work  closely  with  Menendez and his staff to help them understand the merits of delaying the rule, and enlist their help in persuading the unions and port companies that this  is the right course.

The document contains internal deliberations and recommendations made by government officials, as well as consultations with other agencies and stakeholders. These types of communications are typically considered privileged and exempt from disclosure under Exemption 5.; ; One case that supports this conclusion is NLRB v.

The Court explained that the purpose of the exemption is to ""prevent injury to the quality of agency decisions"" by allowing officials to engage in frank and open discussions without fear of public disclosure.; ; Similarly, in Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 617 F.2d 854 (D.C. Cir. 1980), the D.C. Circuit held that Exemption 5 protects ""predecisional, deliberative communications"" that are ""part of the agency's deliberative process"" and ""reflect the give-and-take of the consultative process."" The court explained that such communications are ""often candid and frank"" and ""may contain recommendations, opinions, and other subjective analyses that are not intended to be the final word on the matter.""; ; Based on these precedents, it is likely that the draft ""Healthy Port Initiative"" document would be protected under Exemption 5, as it contains internal deliberations and recommendations made by government officials and consultations with other agencies and stakeholders."

(Category  I  is clean;  category  2 passes  tests but has some contamination; category 3 is not suitable for disposal in the ocean.) Governor Whitman has pledged not  to  put category  2 in  the  ocean,  and  that  pledge has been strongly endorsed by environmental groups and  shore  newspapers,  but there  are very few alternatives for category 2 disposal in the short  term.  Our  initiative proposed a decision by January 31, 1997 concerning the phase out of the Mud Dump Site, with the consideration of the alternatives for disposal.;     • The EPA testing rule. This is a proposed rule revising  the regulations  governing how and when to test for contamination  in dredge material.    A New Jersey federal court opinion argues that EPA's technical manuals conflict with its underlying regulation -- rendering permits legally vulnerable. Environmentalists have derided EPA's rule as a ""rollback""  of ocean protection. Unions and port operators want the rule finalized as soon as possible, believing the rule change essential if permits to dispose material at the MDS are to survive court challenges. Our initiative proposed EPA action on the rule by August 1, I 996.; Positions;     • Menendez: Wants continued use of the MD.S  for both category  I  and  2 material,  and continued ocean disposal of category 2 generally.  Wants  EPA  to finalize  its rule in August, to provide certainty to permit applicants.;     • Pallone-Torricelli:   Want closure of MDS after an additional 300,000 cubic yards of category 2, or alternatively after category 2 capacity needs  have  been  met  through 1997.   Want  EPA  to postpone  its rule indefinitely.    In offering these proposals, Torricelli and Pallone are negotiating, in part, on behalf of the environmental groups whose support they  need  in  the  corning  elections.  (Representative  Zimmer, Torriceili's opponent in  the current  Senate  race,  reportedly  has  prepared advertisements castigating Torricelli for supporting ocean dumping.); Recommendation; We recommend that the Administration make a counter-proposal to Pallone and  Torricelli, with the following elements:;     • We would immediately begin  administrative  action  to close  the MDS  to category  2 at the end I997. This action would require a public proposal (this summer), a comment period, and a final  decision  (early  I997).  We  would  make  the  proposal and indicate our intention to close the  site,  but  would  not  pre-judge  the  final outcome of this process.;     • We would insist that the MDS be available as necessary until the end of 1997 for disposal of category 1 and 2 material. This  may  require  an  increase  in elevation  at the site.;     • We would agree to delay the EPA rule until  all of the issues  have  been  discussed with environmentalists and other stakeholders, including a process to  examine scientific issues related to the rule. We anticipate  that  this  process  will  take  six to ten months.;     • We would require, as a condition of these  commitments,  that  key  environmental groups agree to not challenge permits to dispose of category I and 2 material  at  the MDS (using the existing testing rule) until the end of I997.; Pros: This proposal is very close to that outlined by Pallone and Torricelli,  except  that we would use an appropriate administrative process  to  decide  on  closure  of  the  MDS  rather than announcing closure by fiat, and we  would  reject  the strict  volume  limitation  they propose in the interim. We would expect  that this will  disarm  environmental  criticism  and help move short-term dredging, but we would  want  to  elicit  an  understanding  with  New York and New Jersey that they will not be criticize short-term use of the MDS.; Cons: It will be difficult to convince  Representative  Menendez  that  this  approach  makes sense. Our position will be that  this  approach  will  accomplish  what  he  needs  by  ensuring that dredging can go on for the next year, while allowing  continued  use of the  MDS  for the very short term: In addition it will allow the EPA rule issues to  be  resolved  in  a  less contentious climate, after  further  work  with  affected  interests,  thereby  reducing  the likelihood  of  litigation  over  the rule itself.    We will need to work  closely  with  Menendez and his staff to help them understand the merits of delaying the rule, and enlist their help in persuading the unions and port companies that this  is the right course.  We  propose  to have those discussions in; "	"No, the material discussed in this passage would not be protected under FOIA Exemption 5. Exemption 5 applies to ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" This passage does not appear to be a memorandum or letter, nor does it contain any information that would be exempt from disclosure under Exemption 5. There is no mention of privileged communications or deliberative processes that would qualify for protection under this exemption. Therefore, Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity would not apply in this case."

Is the debate about Taiwan relevant to your analysis of FOIA Exemption 5? Explain your reasoning and cite any case law that supports your conclusion.; ; We have discussed the draft ""Healthy Port Initiative"" with labor unions; port operators and shipping interests; moderate environmentalists; Representatives Menendez, Pallone, and Torricelli; and Senator Lautenberg's  staff.  Below  is a summary  of the  remaining  issues and our recommended next steps.

Therefore, FOIA Exemption 5 does not apply in this case. There is no need to cite any case law to support this conclusion as it is a straightforward application of the exemption."
