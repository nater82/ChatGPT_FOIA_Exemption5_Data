Federal law and policy now allows  disposal  of  category  I  and category 2 dredge material  at  this site.  (Category  I  is clean;  category  2 passes  tests but has some contamination; category 3 is not suitable for disposal in the ocean.) Governor Whitman has pledged not  to  put category  2 in  the  ocean,  and  that  pledge has been strongly endorsed by environmental groups and  shore  newspapers,  but there  are very few alternatives for category 2 disposal in the short  term.

This is a proposed rule revising  the regulations  governing how and when to test for contamination  in dredge material.    A New Jersey federal court opinion argues that EPA's technical manuals conflict with its underlying regulation -- rendering permits legally vulnerable. Environmentalists have derided EPA's rule as a ""rollback""  of ocean protection. Unions and port operators want the rule finalized as soon as possible, believing the rule change essential if permits to dispose material at the MDS are to survive court challenges. Our initiative proposed EPA action on the rule by August 1, I 996.; "	It is possible that these items could be protected under FOIA Exemption 5, which covers privileged communications and deliberative process. The EPA testing rule, in particular, may be considered part of the agency's deliberative process and therefore exempt from disclosure. However, it ultimately depends on the specific circumstances and whether the government agency can demonstrate that the information falls under the exemption.

Exemption 5 protects ""inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency."" (5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5)). This exemption has been interpreted to include materials that are ""predecisional"" and ""deliberative"" in nature, meaning they are part of the agency's decision-making process and not yet finalized or publicly available. (NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132 (1975)). ; ; However, it is less likely that the Mud Dump Site initiative would be protected under Exemption 5, as it does not involve inter-agency or intra-agency communications or materials. FOIA Exemption 5 only applies to certain types of government records, and not to all information held by the government. (See Dep't of Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass'n, 532 U.S. 1 (2001)). Therefore, the Mud Dump Site initiative would likely not be protected under Exemption 5."
