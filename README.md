This repository contains the resulting raw data from "Using ChatGPT for the FOIA Exemption 5 Deliberative Process Privilege."  The Quantitative_Prompts directory contains files showing annotations, prompts, and responses for each paragraph in the FOIA dataset obtained from [Providing More Efficient Access To Government Records: A Use Case Involving Application of Machine Learning to Improve FOIA Review for the Deliberative Process Privilege](https://github.com/mfayoub/FOIA-Test-Collection).  The prompt numbers used to identify unique prompts are listed in the paper.  The Qualitative_Prompts directory contains annotations, prompts, and responses of more varied prompts used to explore the explanations from ChatGPT, and these prompts do not have unique identifiers.  Instead, each subdirectory contains an index file aligning the prompt numbers used with the prompts used in that directory.
